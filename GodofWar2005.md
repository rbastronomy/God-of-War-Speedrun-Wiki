# Introduction
# + version history
---------------------------------

Q: Why write a glitch FAQ?

A: Because this game has loads of glitches and other interesting stuff of which
to tell about.


In speedrunning terms, God of War could be said to be "broken". You can skip
entire levels in it and also accomplish other unusual feats like completing the
game without getting any other magics or weapons than the trusty Blades of Chaos
you start with. While the speed trophy for this game wants you to complete it
under 5 hours in-game time, it's possible to complete it in under 1 hour... if
you know what to do.

Even beside that, God of War is mechanically a bit quirky and there are
many glitches in it. Some are random and a plain annoyance while some are
useful for exploits or just fun to mess around with. Doesn't hurt to know
more about them in the process. You can get a lot of extra playtime out of any
game with good glitches!

While this file is called a "Glitch FAQ", it also lists other interesting
tidbits about God of War like easter eggs. So hopefully this file has something
for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the world of God of War and find
something new in it.

# Abbreviations & glossary

Abbreviations: (the most common ones)

GoW = God of War

BoC = Blades of Chaos
BoA = Blade of Artemis
PR = Poseidon's Rage
MG = Medusa's Gaze
RotG = Rage of the Gods
...and so on for the most important gear or attacks.

ยง = 'note to self', something to be tested or modified later.

RTA = Real-Time Attack. A term for a speed run which is timed in real time,
  in comparison to timing a run with in-game time.

c: = credits to



Glossary - some basic terms that are useful to know:

Launch / Lift-up =
  An attack with which you launch enemies in air. For example, the basic
  ascension that is done by holding down triangle. You can lift Kratos up in
  air during most launchers too.

Bounce =
  Some attacks make the enemy bounce a bit after a successful hit. For example,
  the last hit of Apollo's Offensive.

Knockback =
  Some attacks throw the enemy backwards. Can be done in air too.

Downed =
  An enemy which has fallen on its back/on the ground.


I-frames (a.k.a. invulnerability or invincibility frames, etc.) =
  A short period of time during some moves when Kratos is invincible. Attacks
  pass through him and he won't get any damage either. In this game Poseidon's
  Rage or the basic roll are two examples of a move that has i-frames to them.


Tricking =
  A little more esoteric term that in this FAQ refers to manipulating enemy
  behaviour by either using scenery (for example hanging on ledges) or switching
  weapons repeatedly. Enemies seem to lose their will to fight when you do this.

Cancelling =
  Cancelling a move strategically with another move. For example, cancelling
  Blade of Artemis' slow finishers by blocking or rolling gives you an advantage
  in combat.

Minigame-grabbable =
  Most enemies can only be grabbed when they have 'O' (a circle) above their
  head, so this is the term for such an enemy.

False grab =
  Hitting an enemy with a grab when it won't work. Kratos will fumble backwards
  if you do this. Normally it's useless, but sometimes it can be used to
  manipulate enemy behavior (e.g. Gorgons).


Sweet spot =
  A place in the game area to which your enemies can't reach or are otherwise
  blind to. Used to gain advantage in combat.

Out of bounds =
  Anywhere outside the intended game area.


Plume/Valor/Spirit/Might =
  Names of the finishers for Kratos' basic combos. Read the full names of
  attacks (to know which term refers to which) from the game's menu.



Fastest known speed records of God of War 1?

- Segmented runs:

Segmented run means that you play the game through as quick as possible in
multiple parts. The player is allowed to save and retry parts of the game as
many times as they want to get a very optimized final time. Segmented runs are
usually timed with the game's in-game timer, if one exists.


Vipeazone's run:

Vipeazone from China made a segmented any% NG+ run (Easy-mode, Tycoonius) with
the final in-game time of 49 minutes 58 seconds. The full run isn't viewable
anywhere, as far as I know, but there is a narrated compilation of the biggest
skips and other tactics here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Z2u0fzpxM

The playing seems very high quality. The absolute newest skips and optimizations
are missing, but it remains the fastest segmented run that exists at the moment.


Ballofsnow's run:

For a classic (almost) glitchless segmented speedrun on God-mode, you'd do well
to refer to Ballofsnow's old 2006 run. It was made before the big glitch
discoveries, yet remains a somewhat solid run to this day. In-game time at the
end is 2:16:23.

http://speeddemosarchive.com/GodOfWar.html



- Real-Time Attacks:

So what is a RTA? In an RTA you play through the game in one go and time your
playing with an external timer. Real time and in-game time timing work quite
differently in God of War, so these categories may use different tactics and
can't therefore be compared to one another exactly.

There now exist leaderboards of RTA records on God of War-games at Speedrun.com
so check them out if you want.

I've since made a long-form video series documenting how God of War's speedruns
have evolved from the early years to the present. If you're interested:

Any differences between the PS2- and PS3-versions of God of War?

Yeah. The differences are subtle, but they're there.

The developers didn't go out of their way to fix any glitches from the game in
the HD-version, but the increased frame rate does effect how some of the central
game mechanics work. As a rule of thumb, I would say that most tricks that
involve going through walls or abusing small collision flaws are more difficult
to do on PS3, while the game physics are slightly more lenient on PS3. Loading
times are also longer on PS2. This may force you to switch up some tactics
depending on what version you're playing on.



# General gameplay glitches
----------------------------

A. Jumping tricks
-----------------

Just being able to jump higher or longer than you're supposed to can produce
surprisingly destructive results in action-adventure games. God of War is a
good example of this with its complex jump tricks that are almost an art form
in themselves.


Some basic facts:

- Kratos can jump only two times in a row. The first of his jumps is a ground
jump, the second is an airborne (double) jump.

- Landing on ground even for an instant resets Kratos' jump count. Other than
that, there is no known way to get more than two jumps.

- If Kratos starts falling down by running off a ledge, that counts as a jump
and you can only use the second jump after that. Any attack that lifts Kratos
off the ground also counts as a jump.

- Almost all of Kratos' air attacks are affected by his ever diminishing air
momentum. Eventually even an attack that takes Kratos upwards in air won't
help in gaining height and Kratos will plummet down.

So what to do with all this knowledge?



Technique 1: "High Jump"

So, you're going to have to make the best out of two jumps. The first move in
a high jump should generally be an ascension, an attack that takes Kratos high
up in air, since it gives you the highest possible height gain with only one
"jump".

After having ascended you still have your second jump to use. However, you
can't jump directly after an ascension. Now you have to do some attack that
allows Kratos to jump afterwards, for example the air square attack since it
is fast and easy to perform.

- Example of this technique: an ascension, air square attack, jump.

The biggest problem is that Kratos keeps descending during the air square
attack because of sub-par air momentum. Not by much, but that already reduces
the height potential of this tactic. We can do better! Still, this jump can come
in handy in some rare situations, like before Kratos gets any magic.

You get the most height out of this jump if you start with the normal BoC
ascension, then wait until Kratos is at the maximum height before pressing
square and jumping. While it's easier to just buffer the square air attack
early on during the ascension, you don't get as much height that way.

This trick was originally discovered around 2006. BigVEE was one of the earliest
players acknowledging the high jump, but other people may have noticed it too.

Videos:
1, satvara's video of using high jump for a skip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjbxdtxCVBA



Technique 2: "PR High Jump" (c: satvara)

Poseidon's Rage is a rare type of move that resets Kratos' air momentum. So
if you do that after the ascension, Kratos will stay in air far better during
the subsequent air square attack.

- Example: an ascension, PR, air square attack, jump.

This is a handy basic technique all around the game that gives you pretty nice
height and doesn't require upgrades to pull off. Another bonus is that there
are often invisible ledges all around the world of God of War which Kratos can
grab on to after double jump and gain even more height that way!

If you have Lv. 3 Blades, you can do air Cyclone of Chaos in lieu of the basic
air square attack to lose slightly less height.



Technique 3: "Apollo's High Jump" (AHJ) (c: AKheon)

Taking everything out of your air momentum is important. Doing attacks as soon
as possible after jumping makes Kratos' jumps that much more effective. One
move that especially benefits from strict timing is Apollo's Offensive, done
with L1 + X and learnt at Blades Lv. 2.

So try this after the previous high jump motion: instead of just doing a normal
jump, do a jump instantly followed up by L1 + X.

- Example: an ascension, PR, air square attack, jump, *instantly* L1 + X

If you do this correctly, you see Kratos fling himself way up during Apollo's
Offensive. This is enough to pass over many obstacles in this game, and it's
especially useful in areas where there are no invisible ledges Kratos could
grab on to with the basic PR high jump.

In some locations Kratos can also pass through ceilings using AO, so there's
little to not like about this move.

Technique 4: "Blade of Artemis High Jump" (c: satvara)

You get Blade of Artemis a little before the half-way of the game. This weapon,
while technically optional (you can use glitches to go around it), is such a
great asset for high jumping that it shouldn't be missed.

BoA attacks are very resistant to gravity and you can stay in air indefinitely
by just doing the basic BoA air combo and casting a PR in between to reset your
air momentum.

- Example: a BoA ascension, square, square, circle, PR, square, square, circle

You move both forward and upward during the jump, making BoA the best tool for
the longest and highest of jumps. If you have infinite magic from the Dairy
Bastard costume as well, you can continue doing this jump infinitely and thus
can gain infinite height with it!

Videos:
1, satvara's original video of BoA high jump tactics:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG9A08eMdMU


More details about BoA high jumping:

Using Poseidon's Rage Lv. 1 is recommended for BoA high jumping. It doesn't
cost as much magic as the higher level PRs so it can be used more times before
running out of magic. Even though you can give yourself regenerating magic
using a glitch, your magic is still effectively finite if you're not using the
Dairy Bastard costume, and so it helps to have a more cost-effective version of
PR at your disposal.

One oddity with using PR with BoA active is that PR will randomly cut short
at times. This is good in the sense that it shortens the PR animation and makes
your high jump faster. This is bad in the sense that regen magic will not have
as much time to replenish Kratos' magic and the high jump will ultimately be
shorter. Just be prepared for this random element.

There are a few drawbacks to BoA high jumping as well. One is that you can't
jump after BoA air attacks, making your high jumps less flexible to control.
BoA also doesn't have any snazzy jump finishers like Hermes Stomp or Apollo's
Offensive... But there is a remedy to this.



Technique 5: Fuse glitch in high jumping (c: AKheon / BigVEE)

There's a thing called the Fuse Glitch with which you can start doing BoC moves
even while holding BoA. You can do it either on ground or in air, and doing it
in air really helps mix things up with high jumping.

First, with BoA equipped, do a Gorgon Blast (needs Lv. 2 Medusa's Gaze) or
Zeus' Fury bolt in air, then start blocking. Now the glitch is active and you
should see the fiery red BoC graphics on Kratos' hands at the same time as he is
holding BoA. If you now do L1-attacks and afterwards basic attacks, they are
BoC's instead of BoA's. Using your double jump or landing on ground after
letting go of L1 ends the glitch.

So, using this glitch in air makes BoA jumps much more versatile. You can
start BoA high jump from your first jump and later use your double jump in air
to instantly improve your air momentum and gain more height. Or you can use
BoC jump finishers like Hermes Stomp to gain more length. It's a very useful
trick to know and adapt into your jumps.

Videos:
1, AKheon's example of a fuse BoA jump:
        https://youtube.com/watch?v=P1_lrGGK8lM



Technique 6: "BoA Flash Jump" (c: AKheon)

Sometimes you don't want to use PR in your high jump since it resets both your
vertical and horizontal momentum. For instance, if you had running momentum
while starting the high jump, PR will basically stop it in an instant. Use
Gorgon Flash as a substitute for PR instead - it takes less magic, is faster to
cast and is aerodynamically very friendly.

You can still reset your air momentum at any point by using PR instead of a
Flash. And as mentioned, Gorgon Flash directly leads to Fuse Glitch if you need
it, making this jump tactic very versatile and customizable.

- example: jump (with BoA active), s, o, Flash, s, o, Flash...

This jump is more technical and challenging compared to the PR jumps since
things like Kratos' speed and angle as well as the timing of your BoA swipes is
more important. You also need to upgrade Medusa's Gaze to learn Gorgon Flash in
the first place.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChsCmMYenuY


Technique 7: Lenient Air Momentum (LAM) (c: AKheon)

This tactic can be found in some form in all of the main God of War-games.

If an air attacks cancels out by touching ground or water, a certain slowdown
from the attack carries on to normal movement time, causing Kratos to move and
jump as if slightly suspended. This is especially noticeable if an L1-something
attack or Army of Hades becomes interrupted. While normally a nuisance since
this can happen by accident, slowing Kratos down, it can also be used for better
high jumps.

You see, during the suspended time, you have a more Lenient Air Momentum and
rise higher while doing jumping attacks. Unfortunately LAM disappears if you do
an ascension or use your double jump, so while powerful, this tactic also has
big limitations. Its main use is to make your first jump have extremely good air
momentum.

LAM is not that helpful with high jumping until you get BoA. Well, if you have
Lv. 4 Blades you can start LAM, then do two Falling Helios in a row to get
Kratos about as high in air as with an ascension, then use your double jump.
This would be a good PR-less high jump for some situations... it's just that
getting Lv. 4 Blades is usually not very convenient in a speedrun.

After you get Blade of Artemis, it's a different story altogether. You get a
massive height boost to BoA's attacks and greatly increase the usefulness and
speed of BoA high jumps with Lenient Air Momentum. Starting LAM with BoA active
works a bit differently, though. Either use Fuse Glitch or interrupt air AoH by
landing on ground. In any case, LAM is a trick that is useful to know.

If you don't jump instantly after starting LAM but instead run forward for a
second, Kratos will get better forward air momentum. This is useful if you need
to move forward as well as upwards with your jump.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZZbz6nsoQs



Technique 8: Air Grab high jump (c: BigVEE?)

Finally, here's a small extra high jump that is done by first lifting up both
you and a certain type of enemy in air. To be precise, the enemy has to be a
mini-game grabbable legionnaire with a circle just appearing over its heads, or
a Gorgon or a Centaur. Then, after doing a successful air grab to them, you can
follow up with a jump. This may not be higher than a normal high jump, but at
least it needs no magic.



Technique 9: Fuse-less high jumps (c: AKheon)

Later in 2015 another, somewhat specialized high jump technique was found. It's
somewhat peculiar in that it needs Kratos to have at least 2 magics to work.

If you're in air and use Medusa's Gaze of Zeus' Fury air attack, then keep
holding down L2 as you switch to another magic, Kratos enters an unique air
mode where he looks like he's in the magic stance but can use his double jump.
This can come in handy in several different ways.

- you can use double jump more conveniently in between BoA attack strings in
air, and even do the highest BoA Flash jumps without fuse glitch - hence the
name "fuse-less" high jumps.

- it's possible to do a jump very similar to the classic PR high jump with only
MG thanks to this exploit.

About long jumps:

Long jumps basically mean jumps that aim for maximum horizontal reach. Let's
examine the different known tactics long jump tactics, shall we...


Technique 1: using ledges (c: satvara)

If Kratos does a jump while hanging from a ledge, his first jump has full
running speed. Doing basic air attacks now lets Kratos fly a decent length
in air. As simple as that.

Doing BoC air square attack combo is especially helpful and easy for extending
your jump length.

Videos:
1, KevBew63's demonstration:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--XZFUTltsw



Technique 2: using Hermes Stomp

Hermes Stomp is a good jump finisher if you're not planning on grabbing onto
ledges at the end of your jump. Kratos flies diagonally forward and in most
circumstances doing this to finish off your long jump is helpful.



Technique 3: using Apollo's Offensive (c: satvara)

It turns out that Apollo's Offensive is very good for long jumping purposes as
well. Doing the attack repeatedly lets Kratos fly noticeably further than if
you just did a normal jump without any attacks. This tactic is sometimes called
Apollo's Long Jump (ALJ).

Remember that doing attacks as quick as possible after a jump helps in getting
more out of your air attacks. So time your AOs well.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SP9sc2CndY



Technique 4: using LAM (c: AKheon)

The original use for LAM was to do long jumps. LAM works really well together
with Apollo's Offensive, allowing you to do even more AOs in air before Kratos
starts losing height.

Remember to run in place for a second after starting LAM to get good forward
momentum for your upcoming air attacks.



Technique 5: adapt things

High and long jump techniques can be combined in all sort of ways to gain both
height and length. This game is fairly complex in its mechanics and there is a
lot of room for the player to use his or her creativity for adapting good jumps
for different situations. Consider that some new jump configurations are still
being discovered in this game to this day...

One pretty good rule though is to never use ascensions if you're aiming to do
a long jump. You usually need a good forward momentum for a long jump, and you
only get a good forward momentum from a running jump.



Technique 6: Rage long jump (c: tyrhhjy)

A nifty way for flying long horizontal distances is to get hit by enemy attacks
while airborne and Rage active. Depending on the attack, Kratos gets a huge
speed boost to his jump without becoming knocked down, and as a result flies
away a long distance. Could come in handy in some specific circumstance.

       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2NRQ3JQ66o



More about infinite jumps:

Technically this game has an infinite jump, but you need Dairy Bastard to keep
fueling the jump with infinite magic.

With BoC, there is one attack that gives Kratos height every time you do it,
and that is L1 + triangle. So, just do that and PR repeatedly to keep rising up
in air. You can keep doing this as long as you just have magic.

With BoA you have a better infinite jump. We covered it already, but it's
basically doing the BoA basic air combo with PR in between the combos. This
lets Kratos rise up in air quite well while also moving forward.

If you want, you can also count air swimming as a sort of infinite jump tactic.
But more about that later on...


That's pretty much all about jumps in this game so far. You may've noticed that
most of them guzzle magic like there's no tomorrow. But there's a fix for that:



B. Regen magic (c: Satvara)
--------------

After you've defeated Medusa and the Medusa's Gaze-tutorial begins, Kratos gains
regen magic. Now his magic slowly regenerates over time, all the time.

During a normal playthrough Kratos would lose regen magic immediately after he
has shattered enough Minotaurs... but the room you are in is not escape proof,
and by leaving there early you get to keep regen magic until the end of the
game instead. A must-have for a speedrun.

For escaping the room you need either Lv. 2 Blades (for small AO high jumps) or
PR. By doing high jump in front of the doorway of the room you'll hit an
invisible ledge that you can stand on. Do another high jump from there, and
you'll get on top of the room. Just be careful not to fall out of bounds from
there. Do a double jump to reach the corridor ahead, and you're set... Now you
can play the rest of the game with regenerating magic.

Be thankful that we no longer have to do regen magic the old way. It involved
doing a high jump to get back to where you entered the room from. Then, you had
to jump over the wall and inch your way to the next area while half out of
bounds... that was very precise and not very fun stuff. You can see the original
version below as well, if you're curious.

C. Water glitches:
------------------

"THE swimming glitch"

In God of War, you can take swimming with you wherever you want by first
touching water surface and then going out of bounds. Sometimes it can work the
other way around too. In some places it's easy to do, at other places almost
impossible. But the results are always impressive, being able to plow through
the skies as if it was water, exploring the levels in a whole new way.

But what would an otherwise game breaking glitch be without crippling
disadvantages? A lot better, some would say. Here are the reasons why this
glitch can feel a bit limited at times:


Reason 1. You typically need Poseidon's Trident to make use of this glitch.
Kratos cannot enter free diving mode and swim under water surface without
the Trident in most cases, and just being stuck on water surface is not useful.
If you swim on water surface and go out of bounds, Kratos starts rising up in
air uncontrollably and you can't continue.

There is an alternative way to dive beneath water surface, and that is to get
pushed beneath water surface using some collision. This is only possible at a
few opportune places, but hey, this means that now we can do large skips using
air swimming before getting the Trident too!



Reason 2. Not all water can't be used for starting swimming glitch. In some
levels you can't really touch water surface without accidentally slipping back
in bounds because of how the collision is formed around the water pool. Also,
not all that looks like water is actually water. Some splashy areas are just
visual effects that can't be used to start swimming glitch.



Reason 3. You can't operate switches or open gates or push anything while air
swimming. This will prevent your progress at some points in the game, most 
egregiously at the end of the game: if you're still swimming when you reach
Pandora's Box, you'll get stuck. Otherwise some new cool sequence breaks
would've been possible.



Reason 4. You can't stop swimming when you want. You must always find another
water surface to touch or you'll have to swim eternally. What torment!

Well, if you get stonefrozen while swimming and fall on top of slightly angled
collision like a staircase, you lose swimming and may survive. That's the only
other known way to stop swimming in this game, so your options are few.



Reason 5. The camera angles don't update automatically while swimming, reducing
your visibility quite a lot in most cases. If you enter Select-menu, the game
will update the camera but that doesn't work if you're too far out of bounds.

In some cases using a wrong camera angle works to your advantage too, however.
Certain gates and doors do not necessarily exist in the game world if the camera
is not centered on them, so you can slip past them in places like Gates of
Athens by using a wrong camera angle.



Reason 6. You are completely powerless while swimming. You can't block or
attack. Grabbing enemies causes a fine cloud of blood to appear, but nothing
else happens. Not being able to kill anything can also preventsyour progress in
some parts of the game.



Reason 7. Cutting too many corners makes you skip loading triggers, getting you
even more stuck.



Random notes:
- You CAN open chests and kick open doors while swimming.
- Unlike in God of War II or III, Kratos' swimming always looks normal in this
  game. Strange poses do not become stuck on him, nor does his animation turn
  idle when the game is loading new areas.
- The state of air swimmingness will stay on if you save, which means that you
  can get completely stuck in the game if you're careless with this.
- Some obstacles and collision do not exist if you have a wrong camera angle.
  So, with camera manipulation you can in fact skip some obstacles in your way
  while swimming glitch is on. This tactic is used when swimming through Gates
  of Athens in the current RTA route, for instance.

"The opposite of swimming glitch"

Much like how you can swim where there's no water, you can run where there is
supposedly water. You just have to avoid touching the water's surface when
descending down to an area where you'd normally swim. You can do this f.e.
passing through a wall.

The uses for this are pretty limited. The underwater passages were not
designed for normal type of movement, and you quickly encounter many problems
when trying to move there normally. The floors are unstable and Kratos can
actually get stuck to the floor. Most of the swimming areas require Kratos to
move long distances upwards, which is impossible without regen or infinite magic
and a long high jump. Thirdly, you can't operate underwater switches as grounded
Kratos - either the prompts aren't there or you lose control of Kratos after
having used the switch. Either way, it's a no-go.



Glitched jump out of water - A.K.A. "Uber jump" or "XXL jump" (c: GMG)

If Kratos enters water in a specific way, he can cancel an upwards dash out of
water by using his ground jump. This causes him to gain a crazy momentum boost
and a lot of height in the process. Too bad opportunities to use this jump
are pretty few in this game, but at least the glitch is fun to look at.

So basically, you need to run into the water. Just calmly run into it. If you
jump into water so that Kratos starts diving, this glitch doesn't work. Doing
any attacks while landing in water also won't make the glitch happen.

After entering water correctly, dive a little so that you're close beneath the
water surface. Then do an upwards swim dash. As Kratos emerges through water
surface, quickly press X to use your ground jump to have Kratos fly very high
in air. At the top, he can still use his double jump for even more height gain.

This jump also effectively also works as a 'dash', breaking walls or
stonefrozen enemies if you happen to hit them.

Momentum glitch jump (c: GMG)

By doing upwards swim dashes interrupted with grabs, something very strange
happens with Kratos. The momentum from the interrupted dashes keeps increasing
exponentially, first making Kratos do extremely long, nearly uncontrollable
dashes with hyperactive hand motions. If you continue interrupting swim dashes,
soon Kratos' animation goes completely motionless while the dash continues.
This is a good sign that you should be careful now, because continuing doing
the glitch will soon slow the game down to a crawl or might even crash it.

Anyway, if you have charged up this glitch momentum, you can cause Kratos to
fly far away by diving out of water and grabbing at the same time. You need to
be at a correct distance from the water surface before doing this, though. With
enough glitch momentum, Kratos will even fly through walls and you can't
control him at all!

To steer Kratos you need to aim to the opposite direction from where you want
to go to when doing the swim dash. Sometimes the glitch momentum can become
drained by hitting the water surface in a wrong way, so be mindful of that.
Going on ground and doing some ground actions like opening a chest can also
end the glitch.

"Underwater rush speed tactic"

There's a tactic to speed up swimming movement in this game using rushes and
grabs in a correct way. You can interrupt an underwater rush with a grab, making
Kratos halt momentarily (for the grab's duration), but then he will continue the
dash at full speed for a little longer than usual. You can do this several times
in a row during the dash, but the effect becomes weaker the longer the dash
progresses.

You can also cancel out of the rush charging animation by doing a grab. During
the grab, Kratos continues charging like normal, and if you let go of R1 during
it, the rush activates instantly after the grab ends. So, the fastest rushing
motion involves always cancelling a rush with a grab... you get full speed and
it looks like Kratos barely charges dashes at all.



"Strange things of dying in water"

If you die and then drop down into water, Kratos' pose is strangely stiff. Also,
it seems that if you have any horizontal momentum while doing this, it will not
vanish upon hitting water, making Kratos' corpse sometimes move at high speeds
inside water. A pity that this is not useful.



"Passing through water surface"

You can pass through water surface using Lenient Air Momentum. Get LAM at some
place where there's a low ceiling above and water underneath. Then do Apollo's
Offensive... instead of stopping at water surface, Kratos falls straight through
it.

As a side note, LAM also drops Kratos through solid floor in elevators while the
floor is rising underneath kratos.

"Other minor water glitches & tricks" (partially written by GMG)

- "Splash" - upward grabs at the surface cause a landing splash.

- "Crushing" - When using Rush you can crush breakable walls/objects. When you
leap out of the water using a Ascending Dash, the dive retains the properties
of the rush itself so it can break walls/objects OUTSIDE the water.

- "Slope flicker" - on a slope between standing and skimming Kratos will
alternate between swimming and standing. Whipping out Zf/Medusa will change the
effect slightly, as will blocking. It is also altered by having Artemis out
instead.

- "Slope Rush" - Rush into a slope for a brief run.

- "Fast skim" - rush then ascend to the surface.

- If you grab enemies while swimming, they will bleed heavily but receive no
damage. This is only possible while swimming out of bounds.

- If you start hanging on a ledge while ascending to the surface, Kratos will
grab the ledge, but whenever turning away from it, he will rotate 180 degrees
and seemingly hang on nothing. Just a graphical glitch?

- As a passing mention: blood effects are the same underwater as they are on
ground. Looks cheap.



D. Angled surface glitches:
--------------------------

By angled (or "crooked") surface, I mean a special type of collision surface
which makes Kratos slide down when he's on it. It doesn't count as normal floor
since touching it doesn't reset your jump counter, and it also reacts in
different ways if you block or attempt to roll while touching it.


"Gliding"

When on a crooked surface, if you try to block, roll, enter a magic stance
or do a grab, Kratos will not fall down as helplessly as usual, but instead
will either remain where he is or move to some direction, depending on your
momentum. Effects also vary depending on how angled the crooked surface is.

If you have a good momentum, this glitch can be abused to hastily move over
areas with a lot of crooked surface. Kratos' speed can be irrationally high
when doing this, making the whole tactic look odd. Gain momentum by doing a
well-timed Hermes Stomp or a grab or other air attacks when landing on the
crooked surface.

This kind of movement is still a bit limited since your jump counter is not
reset at any point. Also, you are dependant on having good momentum to move
forward at all. But fortunately, there's still more that can be done with this.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of using Gliding at Gates of Athens:
        https://youtube.com/watch?v=2Zad8ne9FyM



"Poseidon jump" (c: AKheon)

When on a crooked surface, you may encounter this glitch if you use PR. Kratos
will do the PR as he always does. Afterwards he enters a short, unique animation
where the game considers him being on normal ground. During this time the jump
counter resets and you can jump two times more before again exhausting Kratos.
If you try to run in any direction before jumping, you will cancel out of this
state, so be careful with L-stick usage.

This unique animation does not always follow PR. Sometimes PR just cancels out
and nothing interesting happens. Remain vigilant and cast PR again before you
are dropped off the crooked surface. Sometimes the PR will not cancel out, but
nothing interesting still happens. It can be a bit unreliable, so be prepared
with lots of magic for this one.

Being able to jump in the middle of a crooked surface increases your
capabilities by a fair amount, allowing a few new tricks to be done.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACDfqY_yT4
        


"Stance flicker"

If you're right at the edge of a crooked surface and while blocking, rolling,
in a magic stance or doing Hermes Stomp, Kratos will not fall down but will
stay on the surface edge and try to do whatever the button press denotes,
but failing each time because the game thinks he's constantly starting to
fall down. The action starts anew and it gets canceled again. Kratos flickers
strangely and makes noises.

E. Misc glitches
----------------

"Music glitch"

What this glitch means is basically that the Rings of Pandora background music
will get stuck after you visit that map. The track will then continue to play
alongside all other game audio until you reset the console. This glitch happens
automatically and there's nothing you can do to prevent it either, although I'm
not sure if it happens in every version of the game.

Having the music glitch active causes your PS2 some extra strain since the game
is forced to stream more music than expected, making everything load slower than
normal. The extra loading time is not noticeable on the PS3 version, though.

While the Rings of Pandora background music is nice to listen to, generally the
music glitch is just a hindrance to the player with the longer loading times.
The only potential use music glitch has is that you can do some skips with it:
if you're fast, you are able to get past some obstacles before they load. That's
something, at least.

Videos:

        https://youtube.com/watch?v=PACPzKSQXm8



"A few words about skipping loading triggers"

The game loads its areas mostly in realtime. When Kratos steps to a certain
invisible trigger in the level, the next area begins to load. By skipping one
of these triggers you will not be able to proceed, but instead are confronted
with emptiness where the next section should begin. It's not useful except in
some very specific cases, though. Well, if something like this happens to you,
now you know why.



"Black-out glitch" (c: AKheon)

You know when the game is loading, but you can already start moving although the
screen is still black? Let's call this time "black-out time". You most often see
it when loading a game from the main menu, but you can artificially create it
by upgrading Blades and then retrying. So what makes it so interesting?

During black-out time, Kratos can pass through any triggers in the game world
without them activating! It's a cheap way to get past some fights without them
starting if there's a checkpoint right before where the fight is. Just upgrade
Blades, retry, then quickly roll past the trigger before gameplay starts as
normal. It's as if the fight never existed.

The biggest increase in black-out time comes from upgrading Lv. 1 Blades to
lv. 2 Blades, likely because you get Rage of the Gods and the game has to
load some extra data pertaining to it. None of the non-Blades upgrades give you
any black-out time, though, which is too bad.

Another way to create black-out time is to become checkpointed in air. If you
now retry from the checkpoint, the screen stays black for a second or two, often
until Kratos' feet hit the ground. It can sometimes come in handy if there is a
trigger right beneath Kratos that you want to get past.

Air black-out time can overlap with upgrade black-out time to a degree. But
still, your best chances for actually using this trick for good is to stick with
load game black-out time or upgrading black-out time.

Here's a list of what gives you black-out time and how much. Note that these
times can vary for unknown reasons.

Loading a save from main menu =         more than 2 secs.
Upgrading Lv. 1 Blades to Lv. 2 Blades =         1.2 secs.
Any other Blades upgrade =                      0.9 secs.
Checkpointed in air =                       varies a lot.

The bad part is that the power of this trick is directly tied to the locations
of checkpoints and save points in the game. In some instances you can manipulate
where checkpoints appear, giving some leeway, but save points are pretty much
fixed and you just have to accept it... at least until a glitch is found where
you can save wherever you want. That would be quite convenient!

To elaborate, it's possible to move many common checkpoints around the levels
by being in air while hitting them. This way you delay them activating until
Kratos hits ground again. With long jump techniques, you can move checkpoints
closer to triggers that can be skipped with black-out time...


Other notes:

- Aside cutscene and other event triggers, you can also go past death collision
and some map transitions during black-out time. Water surface cannot be passed
with black-out glitch.

- If you retry a checkpoint from far away to your last checkpointed location,
the game is forced to load longer than usual when retrying... but it isn't
black-out time and you can't move during it.

- Apparently there are some differences between game versions where checkpoints
are moved around or save points disabled at certain places... this means that
different game versions have unique skips with black-out time.

- At least on PS3, the music glitch doesn't help with the black-out time length.

"Petrification glitches"

- If Kratos becomes petrified while swimming glitch is on, he will become
  crushed upon landing on the ground, even if he is as close to ground level as
  possible. However, if there are stairs or other angled surface below him, he
  has a chance to survive. This is one of the few ways to end swimming glitch
  in this game.

- If Kratos is stonefrozen and falls out of bounds, he will never die from the
  death zone below. However, break free from the stoneform, and then you'll die
  like normal again.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of these two entries:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLRLglAiPdo#t=168


- Enemies still attempt to target Kratos after he is shattered by a Gorgon,
  and you can hear him grunt if he is hit.

- Kratos can still examine prompts after being shattered.

- Arrows don't always crush petrified Kratos.

- An extremely rare glitch concerning retrying with petrified Kratos can leave
  him in a slow-moving state after having retried. Getting petrified and
  breaking out is the only known way to fix it.

- As Kratos becomes petrified, enemies take a momentary break from attacking.
  This is the same in GoWII too.

- Depending on the enemy and the area, sometimes freezing enemies en masse can
  cause enemies to unexist. One of the best spots for this is the Pandora's
  Temple lobby battle with the Wraiths.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's vid of enemies unexisting as they're petrified:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4gkbZo1bpA


- If too many enemies (over two at once?) are shattered simultaneously not all
  of them give you red orbs.

- Shattering enemies with Plume can give you double the red orbs.

- Flying enemies sometimes do not fall down when stonefrozen.

- If Kratos becomes petrified on top of a ladder or some other special surface,
he will become petrified in such a way he can never break out! Would this work
on your enemies as well?

Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tSFbZzisz8



"Death glitch"

Sometimes Kratos can continue living even after his death - he moves in the
background as the screen slowly turns red and the game over screen appears like
normal. This glitch can be unstably reproduced, but as of now no use has been
found for it.

Wulf2k9's new info revealed that the death glitch happens - at least in theory -
as a result of Kratos having less than 1 but more than 0 health after getting
damaged. You see, having health drop below 1 means that you get the game over
screen, while Kratos literally dies at 0 health. Therefore, having health
between 0 and 1 makes you not die although you get a game over screen.

Random facts:
- Saving while dead will yield you an alive Kratos with very little health left.
  Apparently checkpoints save Kratos' health as a whole number, rounding up,
  which means that you'll be back to 1 health after retry.
- I think it's not possible to activate checkpoints (and maybe other type of
  triggers) while death glitch is happening.

It's also possible to cheat death by gaining a Gorgon Eye upgrade at the same
time Kratos buys the farm. This way he physically dies, emitting the death grunt
and landing on his back, but the death screen itself becomes skipped. So you
can continue playing as dead, or at least "paralyzed" Kratos. Too bad you're
now stuck since you lack control of him, and there is no known way to get his
back on his feet. Even Raging about it won't help.

"Checkpoint glitches & observations"

When retrying from a checkpoint, all the game conditions do not revert back
to what they used to be. The game simplifies things and cuts some corners,
enabling some slightly interesting stuff to happen. Morsels of data follow:

- Some visual effects (like blood) or sounds are still around after retrying.

- Enemies' vertical locations are reverted back. So, enemies checkpointed in
  air remain in air after retry.

- Enemies' current animations and poses aren't reverted back exactly. This can
  cause small graphical glitches for enemies wielding weapons or trying to
  counterattack (especially if you had checkpointed them in air).

- Game remembers if enemies are petrified, and how long their petrification
  timer is. There are small issues with this, though. Sometimes enemies may
  lose their petrification on a retry before gaining it back on another retry.

- Game remembers if enemies are dying, but not at what point their death
  animation is. This allows you to do an infinite red orb glitch...

- Kratos' vertical height is stored in the memory, so you can actually save
  in air. This causes black-out time, as usual. Doing high jumps after having
  saved in air won't work - in fact, you have no jumps remaining at all if you
  respawn in air.

- Kratos' hitbox is his old one maybe one frame after retry? This can cause him
  to slide away from walls if you had saved next to one if you were doing
  certain moves like Hermes Stomp while retrying. Or, well, it's hard to
  pinpoint exactly what mechanism is at work here...

- Game does remember if Kratos was swimming or not.

- Game always reverts Kratos back to wielding BoC.

- Game remembers if time is stopped (as in during cutscenes). So if you become
  checkpointed at a wrong time, this mechanism will cause a softlock.

- Normally Kratos can't become checkpointed in air, but certain types of event
  checkpoints can do this. If you're unlucky, Kratos can become checkpointed
  right as he is falling into a chasm, dying over and over again.

- You can become checkpointed while standing on poles or hanging on ladders.
  However, hanging onto ledges the game considers the same as being in air, so
  Kratos falls down upon retry.

- You can save a little outside a save point by doing a roll or a Hermes Rush
  and pressing R2 at the last moment before exiting the save point range.

- Athena's Rage of the Gods-dialogue clip when you upgrade Blades to Lv. 2
  continues playing if you retry from checkpoint. You can overlap it who knows
  how many times by upgrading, then quickly retrying, then upgrading again...
  also, it's interesting how the sound actually continues playing in the main
  menu if you choose to quit game during it.

- You can buffer the press of X-button over a checkpoint retry. Probably not
  useful in any way, but just to get it out there. This works in GoW II too.

- For some reason the game sometimes takes a really long time loading the last
  checkpoint if you had created the checkpoint while interrupting a swimrush
  charge with a grab.

- If you choose to save extremely quickly after retrying from a checkpoint, the
  save screen may end up completely black. You can hear the selector move if you
  press directional keys, but whether it should be on 'yes' or 'no', the game
  chooses 'yes'. Then things return to normal.

- And just to note: whenever you retry, the game clock reverts back too. Good
  for speedrunning if you're going by in-game time.



"Game freezes"

Unfortunately God of War is a game that can crash or freeze occasionally. I've
seen a crash happen at loading screens, boss fights, before cutscenes, before
loading a game... it can happen at almost any time, and the reasons are unknown.
Your likelihood of encountering a crash may increase if your game has scratches
on it.
One thing I've seen crash the game occasionally is to tap X while upgrading
something. So this should be avoided. In general the game also seems to become
more crash-prone if you play it for longer periods of time, so keep that in
mind too.



"Disc tray glitch"

The disc tray glitch is basically that by opening the disc tray at a specific
time, you get the disc tray complaint message but the game continues underneath
it. This shouldn't happen and it has a few side effects.

In God of War II doing this had the questionable use of stopping in-game timer
entirely, albeit at the price of losing visibility and being able to access
menus at all. In God of War it does even less, because it apparently doesn't
stop in-game time, rendering it useless for its already dubious purpose.

Yeah... before you start asking, disc tray glitches shouldn't be considered
legit speedrunning tricks. At best you could experiment with them in GoWII to
go beyond some hard-to-skip cutscene triggers to see what would happen.

The only place I've noted disc tray glitch working in God of War is at Aegean
Sea, at the very start of the game. Sometimes opening disc tray after having
retried from the first checkpoint the glitch starts and you can continue playing
with the disc tray message blocking your screen. Tyrhhjy also suggested that
this glitch can be done right before FMVs, but this is unverified.

Atrexthiswork noted later that if you upgrade things without the disc inside,
this can cause invisible effects, such as invisible Blades of Chaos on Kratos.

Videos:

"Loud sounds"

One thing that's bothered me for a long time in this game is that some of the
audio clips, like comments made by Gods as you gain new powers, are always at
full volume even if you had changed audio volume from the Options-menu.
Guess it can't be helped...




F. Eye/Feather glitches
-----------------------

"Upgrade animation lag"

If you enter the menus while upgrading health or magic as Kratos' health bar
is growing larger, slightly strange things can happen. This process of upgrading
creates something that could be called lag, even if that is not the exact name
for it. Here are the various symptoms I've noted to happen:


--- In the start menu:

+ the most obvious effect: as the background upgrading process ends, you can't
  switch pages in the menu with L1 and R1 any longer (until leaving the menu.)

+ you can continue funneling orbs even inside the upgrade message window. This
  can cause "fake upgrades" (a completely empty upgrade window is shown as the
  background process ends). Pressing up or down, you can also upgrade something
  else while the previous one's upgrade message is still showing. This has no
  other effects than that the wrong magic flashes afterwards. You can even make
  it seem like you upgraded a locked magic.


--- In the select menu:

+ as the background process ends, cursor placement is frozen in any sub-menu.
  If you were in the main menu, no effect is shown. Basically, this "frozen"
  effect actually means that the game put the cursor back in the main menu even
  though the graphics still show the sub-menu. You can press up/down and hear
  cursor movement - you can't see its position since the wrong window is active.
  Pressing X will cause the prompt from main menu to begin, wherever the cursor
  was. If you end up in the same sub-menu you left from, small graphical
  glitches occur. Otherwise, the menu works like expected.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid showing these variations:
       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPbn7vQVA6g



"Infinite Eye/Feather animation"

During the screen which informs you you have collected enough Gorgon Eyes or
Phoenix Feathers to upgrade, if you press start or select so that you enter
the menu RIGHT as the little Eye/Feather-animation starts to roll, it will
remain looping infinitely. So watch out for this.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz32PmbZq8w#t=172



"Eye/Feather message + save prompt glitch"

In at least one place of the game, it's possible to delay save menu with a
correctly timed Eye/Feather message. This causes an unique effect since the save
menu carries over checkpoint retry! After retry you enter a graphic-less version
of the save menu, and also depending on if you had activated the save menu in
your game session prior to this, you might not be able to choose 'yes' or 'no',
at worst getting stuck in the menu for an eternity.

If the menu is indeed functional and you save and retry, nothing too interesting
happens: the chest you just opened is now closed and in effect you never got the
Eye or Feather. So the chest became wasted.

The save prompt can carry on to New Game, or so I've gathered, but unfortunately
it will always crash the game (right before first gameplay starts). I've tried
to carry it over to Character Graveyard and CotG, but to no avail.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bz0cq-c_o#t=300



"Doing other stuff as you get an Eye/Feather upgrade"

You have a short time after opening an upgrade chest before the actual upgrading
window sets in. Could it be possible to do something interesting during that
time? Well, the answer is...

The most interesting outcome is probably dying right before a health upgrade
comes up. This causes Kratos to survive having lost all his health, but he
remains dead and totally immobile on the ground. Enemies aren't interested
in him any longer, and you just get stuck doing this.

It's possible to drop down a chasm before the upgrade comes up. Kratos can't die
as long as the upgrading window is open. So you can fall much deeper into chasms
than normal, and... that's pretty much what you can do with it.

If you pick up a foe with grab select while the upgrade window appears, Kratos
is prevented from doing anything with the grab and it automatically fails.

If you activate a new checkpoint while time is frozen (like always while the
Eye/Feather upgrade is taking place), upon retry Kratos is frozen and nothing
can help him. You have to quit the game to continue.

So, what happens if you don't have any magic and then get a magic upgrade?
After all it's possible to collect some Phoenix Feathers and upgrade your magic
without even having a magic bar. Well, the upgrading starts... and then you get
a magic bar, but not the upgrade. Oh well.

G. Menu glitches

"Various menu glitches"

- If you press Start or Select the instant the "You Are Dead"-screen appears,
  the other button of those two is disabled after retry. The glitch fixes itself
  after you've visited either Start- or Select-menu once after that. It seems
  this can also happen if you press Start or Select the instant an FMV begins.

- In the start menu, if you press 'up' and simultaneously press L1 or R1, the
  following screens will have some small graphical glitches. If you go to the
  screen where Gorgon Eyes and such is listed, the icons are out of place until
  you move the cursor. In the case of magic and weapon menu, every icon becomes
  empty until you leave the screen or upgrade something. Every magic and weapon
  is also listed as Lv. 1, even if they really aren't. Also, the game may
  target some other magic than the one right at the bottom which is the default
  choice.

- Doing the above glitch entering the weapons / magic menu, you can sometimes
  see a glitch item that is only 1 orb away from being upgraded, and which you
  can never activate.

- If you move the cursor in a certain way (too fast or while selecting something
  for example) the texts in the menus may overlap. This is really quite rare,
  and completely useless to boot.

- If you visit menu when a basic 'yes' / 'no' menu is on the screen, like when
  the game asks you if you want to pick up something, you expand your list of
  choices from 2 to 5! Too bad that these new choices seem to be but glitched
  versions of 'no', with game time staying frozen afterwards, forcing you to
  retry from last checkpoint.

- Hey, it looks like we can do a PS3-exclusive graphical menu glitch now! Choose
  to load from last checkpoint and instantly go to the PS3-menu. The game is
  forced into the select-menu as usual, but this time it is completely black
  until you press some button.

"Tutorial message and prompt glitches"

There are different kind of tutorial messages in the game. Some freeze game
time while some are more subtle, allowing Kratos to move while they are visible
on the screen. Let's call the latter ones "fluid" tutorial messages, shall we?

When you have a fluid tutorial message on your screen, you are able to buffer
some other prompts to happen multiple times. For example, starting to examine
the cabin door at Aegean Sea when the climbing combat tutorial is shown. You
can buffer up to four cabin door messages to show in a row by spamming R2 near
the door. However, it seems that not all prompts can be buffered repeatedly -
for example, talking to Athena statue doesn't seem to become buffered multiple
times. It would be cool to see if you could buffer multiple item pick-up
prompts using this trick, but it remains to be seen if it is even possible to
try out anywhere in the game... fluid tutorial messages are pretty scarce.

Going into a cutscene while a fluid tutorial message is already showing causes
nothing interesting to happen. The tutorial message just stays there until its
timer runs out and disappears and the cutscene works like normal.

When you first upgrade the Blades to Lvl. 2, you get a tutorial message about
using Rage of the Gods. You can queue this message with other in-game messages
or even cutscenes if you upgrade your Blades at some inconvenient time. I think
you can get even 4 messages queued in a row doing this... it's not very useful,
though.

It's possible to get the "You Are Dead"-screen the next frame after having
upgraded and exited the menu. In this case the tutorial message is cancelled.

You are sometimes able to examine a prompt (like a locked door) and then move
to a cutscene while the prompt is still active. This is especially easy using
swimming glitch, since swim dash moves you a very long distance during the time
the examination message is showing and time is "stopped". This can cause an
unique glitch effect if you happen to activate a checkpoint while the message
is showing, since the game will remember that time is stopped over a checkpoint.
After retry, Kratos is immobile, and the message is gone... you have no way to
regain control, and must quit and reload.

The prompts of Architect's trap designs are unique in their two-part nature.
First there's the image close-up for a few seconds after which you get the
actual message. If you dash into the cutscene at the door during the close-up
part, the timed message is saved by the checkpoint... each time you retry, you
get the message to show in the middle of the door cutscene. Closing the message
now makes the door cutscene itself cancel out much earlier than it should. Wish
you could do this at other cutscenes during the game, would create some nice
glitches.

H. Move / Weapon / Magic info and glitches
------------------------------------------

"General moves"

- The hit counter is suspended during rolls. So for creating the longest combos,
  you gain advantage by rolling until you can get another hit in.

- Rolls have a small period of i-frames to them, allowing you to roll through
  enemy attacks without Kratos getting hurt at all.

- Blocking in air causes Kratos to fall down quicker. This trick can be used for
  interesting juggling combos, or to just save time whenever falling down.

- Sometimes pressing X after air attacks can make Kratos fall down very quickly
  instead of doing a jump.

- If you attack or block early during a jump, Kratos will land with a heavy
  stomp, unlike normal. This slows you down a little. However, doing something
  instantly as you land or a little before landing removes this stomp, saving a
  little time.

- Using any magic or throws which enable you to target things, you can see
  currently spawning enemies as targets way before they can actually be damaged
  in any way.



"Something extra about Lenient Air Momentum"

Air attacks can work a little strangely while you have LAM. At the end of them,
Kratos can do a glitchy ground jump for some reason, amounting to a total of
three jumps. It's not very useful since a ground jump has a very bad momentum,
but pretty cool to note.

It can also be noted that LAM carries over to ladders, shimmying on ledges and
ropes, looking slightly odd. You can also do a strange airwalking by spamming
Medusa's Gaze off a ledge when Kratos has some LAM in store.

Another thing, Kratos can clip through any rising floor while LAM is in effect.
Too bad there aren't that many rising floors in the game.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iemyDTrfWc



"Climbing wall glitches"

- While Kratos is climbing a wall, he can insta-kill enemies that are nearby on
  the ground by grabbing them. Pretty unfair.

- If ground enemies get hit by an enemy that Kratos is grabbing while on the
  wall, they suffer quite an immense knockback, a sight to behold.

- If the collisions around the climbing zone are even slightly unstable (and
  they usually are), Kratos can leap towards them and for a moment cast magic.
  You know it is possible when the magic icon at the upper left corner flashes
  to active, even if only momentarily. The timing is pretty precise, but you
  can easily try it over and over again until you finally get it. Be warned
  that Kratos may fall off the climbing wall after casting the magic.



"Rope glitches"

- If you flail on a swinging rope with some obstacle behind you, Kratos will
  stop moving but the momentum nonetheless gathers as if no obstacle was there.
  It doesn't look good. An easy place to try this out is at the Road to Athens
  with the barricades before the rope section.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz32PmbZq8w#t=246


- There's a way to cast magic on ropes and gain advantage in long rope
  sections! Note that this strategy is not risk-free, but it's fun to use for
  speeding things up.

  Here's how to do it: let go of the rope and cast magic, for example Gorgon
  Flash works wonders... then do Apollo's Offensive as quickly as possible.
  Kratos will hopefully get high enough from AO that he grabs the rope again,
  allowing you to continue on your way without falling down.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Wo42I1oEk#t=68


- Due to cramped spaces or other reasons, grabs enemies do on Kratos on rope can
  glitch up strangely. There's more about this in the general enemy glitches.



"Rage of the Gods"

- You can abuse enemy attack momentum to do long jumps if you have RotG on.
  First, get hit by an attack that has lots of vertical strength (while in air),
  then jump again before hitting ground. (c: tyrhhjy)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid
       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2NRQ3JQ66o


- During Rage of the Gods, if you try to cancel into Ascension from roll
  (keeping triangle held down), the move self-cancels strangely. (thanks to GMG)

- During RotG, your grab turns much faster to spam than normal. However, a grab
  that follows a roll is still the same old slower grab non-RotG Kratos does.

- During RotG, the counter Hades' Reverse can be used, but none of its
  follow-ups.

- During RotG, Kratos never does his heavy landing animation, as in after doing
  an air attack for example. This increases your general maneuverability, and it
  also allows you to go crazy with Hermes Stomp, being able to spam it super
  fast. Hold R1 down and tap X and watch Kratos go.

- Some of Kratos' previous momentum carries over if he lands while blocking, so
  doing Hermes Stomp with RotG active and then holding L1 to block causes Kratos
  to 'zip' forward a little after landing.

- If you hold down L2 after doing Hermes Stomp with RotG active, Kratos enters
  a glitched pose where he looks idle. Pressing buttons suddenly activate the
  prepared magic instead.

- After having Lv. 2 or more MG, shooting Gorgon Blast and then holding down L2
  as Kratos falls down causes a glitch. After landing Kratos should
  automatically whip out MG again, but in this case he won't. He stays in the
  idle pose instead, but any additional button press cause him to take out MG.

- If you upgrade Blades during RotG, the color of your weapons will revert from
  blue back to the more commonly seen fiery red. This also happens if you start
  RotG while the game is still in black-out mode (from having loaded a game).



"Upgrading glitches"

At its basic form: if you upgrade a magic while you're using it, it cancels out
or at the very least its effects disappear. The same effect continues to happen
for a brief moment if you retry after having upgraded the magic and try to cast
it. The effects of particular magics are listed below in the magic-specific
sections.

When upgrading BoC and retrying, you create "black-out time" that allows some
exploits. There was its own section for it above.

Upgrading BoA and retrying may cause BoA to disappear momentarily once the
gameplay has resumed.

1. Blades of Chaos

Kratos' iconic weapon, the Blades of Chaos. You start with them.

- It takes over a minute to upgrade the Blades from Lv. 1 to Lv. 5! That's how
  slow the orb funneling speed is in this game, and it's also something to
  consider in a speed run going for real time.

- Plumes that get canceled before impact at a certain point create the explosion
  but do no damage.

- Stonefrozen enemies (and perhaps other objects too) give out double red orbs
  if they are shattered with a Plume. Could be useful to know.

- The Might of Hercules ender can do up to 4 hits. This makes it worthwhile
  to use, even though a single hit isn't very strong. Also notice that it's
  possible to do the ender without a long combo beforehand by doing a simple
  square, square, SQUARE (pressing down).

-  Also, some comboing combinations using Might of Hercules has Kratos whipping
  out Medusa's Gaze for a few frames for absolutely no reason - even if he
  hasn't picked up the magic yet.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPbn7vQVA6g#t=110


- Orion's Harpoon, when done on enemies that are just low enough, will only hit
  but not throw them.

- While you can grab enemies through wall, Orion's Harpoon can't contact through
  a wall.

- Apollo's Ascension (L1+X) is a very similar move to normal ascension on the
  surface, but they do have their differences. AO is faster and has a different
  arc from normal ascension: while doing it, Kratos moves slowly forward in air.
  But as a drawback, he also rises a little less high. The best part about AO is
  that it doesn't need any space on the ground to do it, making it perfect for
  doing launches from risky places like right next to chasms.

- Apollo's Offensive (air L1+X) is a very convenient move for high/long jumping
  applications, as was detailed above. You can also pass through water surface
  with it... or ceiling occasionally... no wonder they removed it from GoW II.

- Rising Helios (L1+triangle) is actually a ground-based move and Kratos does
  not rise in air while doing it. Pretty disappointing.

- Falling Helios (L1+triangle) is one of the few moves in the game with which
  you can do infinite jump with.

- Hermes Rush (R1) is an interesting move during Kratos becomes slightly more
  thin and long than usual. This allows you to shift your way into some cramped
  spaces and leverage yourself out of bounds by turning slightly.

Videos:

        https://youtube.com/watch?v=TahZ0khKQSo



An own section dedicated to Hermes Stomp:

Hermes Stomp (air R1) goes right through some larger enemies such as cyclops.
Sometimes you can clip through walls using Hermes Stomp as well! What a handy
move.



"Rope + L1-move + HS = trouble"

If you pass a rope while doing a L1 + something move (e.g. Apollo's Offensive)
and at its end perform the Hermes Stomp, a glitch happens. The game thinks
Kratos is on the rope while Stomp's animation transports him away. This state
has no movement checks, so Kratos is eternally stuck in the Stomp pose.

During this time, your enemies will register Kratos as both ground and rope
target. F.e. legionnaires will attempt to jump on a rope even if Kratos is on
the ground right next to them. However, at another location a Gorgon actually
attacked Kratos who was stuck, inadvertently releasing him!

To be honest, this glitch can happen without an L1-move too. For example, if
you're unlucky when an enemy attacks you - you fall down from the rope but get
stuck. But this is very rare.

In some locations (like the CoH Archer Rope) Kratos may teleport back on rope
after doing a glitchy Hermes Stomp elsewhere. Hard to say why it happens.

Later I noticed that this trick works with balancing beams as well. There is
a small difference in that doing this variation, Kratos can turn after reaching
the final Stomp Pose, but nothing else. By turning at correct times, you can hit
nearby enemies! You are still, after all, in the middle of Hermes Stomp's attack
part. If you get stonefrozen like this, you can't break out for some reason.

"Moving Pandora's Box with Hermes Stomp"

You can move the Box around before the elevator has descended using well-placed
Hermes Stomps. Why? Hard to guess. This story becomes even more bewildering
once you discover that this is not possible at the bottom of the elevator any
more... Maybe it's a different Box object altogether.

2. Blade of Artemis

BoA is a secondary weapon you get at the beginning of Challenge of Atlas. It's
a huge blade emitting an eerie purple glow.

Unlike any other weapon in the first three games, Blade of Artemis doesn't have
a grab. Instead, it has another normal attack for circle. This can lead to
mix-ups when attacking enemies that have a mini-game circle above their heads...
there is its own section about the glitches this causes below.

You also can't block in air when wielding BoA.

While you can switch weapons from BoC and BoA with a bulky animation on ground
or in air, you can't switch back from BoA to BoC in air... except there's a
glitch that emulates this effect (the fusing glitch).



"Fusing BoA and BoC"

Like mentioned in the high jumps section, you can "fuse" BoA and BoC
temporarily, so that both of them are visible at the same time. This is mostly
just a graphical effect, with no influence on the damage Kratos does for
example.

The easiest way to start the glitch is to do either Zeus' Fury or Gorgon Flash
in the air with BoA equipped. During the magic animation, press down L1 and keep
it held down. That's it at its simplest. You can now do L1-specials with BoA in
Kratos' hands. This is also the only known way to switch from BoA attacks to BoC
attacks in mid-air.

Another, less practical way to do this is through a glitch grabbing attempt
with BoA. You need to have a creature with 'grab select', like a basic
legionnaire. After having grabbed the enemy, let the grab time out while
holding block. After the enemy has freed himself, Kratos is now in Fuse-mode,
ready to kick ass with two weapons at once. Well, no, this really isn't all
that special...

The fuse glitch will last only as long as you have the L1-button down, don't
cast magics or get damaged. Other than the L1 + something moves, you can also
do weapon switching and Hermes Stomp without losing this effect. The last one
is actually something very useful, because Hermes Stomp adds much length to
your jumps, and it is normally unavailable during a BoA long jump. You can
really mix things up during high jumps as well.

Videos:

"Other BoA glitches and oddities"

- If you try to do the BoA circle attack after a forward roll, you only hear the
  sound but no attack happens.

- If you do a BoA ascension that hits a low ceiling and after that fall down in
  a chasm, Kratos will stop in air as a part of his ascension animation for a
  moment as if landing on ground. Then he resumes falling.

- The BoA air triangle attack typically takes a long time to charge before
  Kratos finally slam downs his sword, but if the move follows weapon change or
  any of the magics it resolves quick instead.

- In rare circumstances doing the air triangle attack can lead to Kratos falling
  through ground... Architect's Tomb entrance has one spot where it happens.

- The air triangle move of BoA deals 0 damage to enemies if it hits. While it
  looks like a powerful downsmash, it isn't effective at all.

- If you're casting Lv. 2 or Lv. 3 PR in air with BoA equipped, the PR animation
  randomly cuts short for no reason, reducing the damage potential of your magic
  in the process.

- If you switch weapons quickly enough, the BoA flash effect is not always seen.

- The BoA glow is not seen in some areas.

- An useless trick: during load game black-out time, switch weapons to BoA and
  start running. When the graphics show up, Kratos will run as if holding
  Blades of Chaos, but with BoA in his hands. (c: GMG)



"Homerun and its variations" (c: GMG)

Using double lauches with Blade of Artemis, your enemies can be sent extremely
high up in the air or bounced around the place in unusual ways. It's an exploit
of sort, only possible thanks to BoA's strange attack properties.

There are three main variations of it, Spike, Punt and Homerun, dubbed neatly
after sports terms by this trick's discoverer, GMG.

Obviously, if a foe can't be launched none of this works.

1. Homerun is a BoA launch followed by another BoA launch. First launch takes
enemy skyward. Second causes a knockback and a launch, causing the enemy to fly,
as has been suitably put, "up and away." You can use it to get enemies over
invisible boundaries and into chasms.

2. Spike, an "elevated knockback", is using BoA's air triangle attack on a
launched enemy. Will not clear invisible walls. Can cause a bounce + Knockback
effect if enemy hits solid ground. It works well for transporting single enemies
to fixed directions.

3. Punt is a launch after a bounce. This move strangely makes enemies ignore any
invisible walls around the arena, causing them to fly to their deaths with
surprising ease.

More exceptions/glitches:
- If you were wondering what would happen if you did a triple BoA launch, well,
  nothing too interesting happens. The exploit doesn't give more unusual extra
  height after the second launch.
- As mentioned, these attacks don't work well against Satyrs, other than Punt.
  This is because they have a strange 'aerial recovery' which stops the launch
  in its tracks. Spike doesn't always fail but isn't reliable either.
- A Cerberus Breeder, when launched with a Spike, will look like its merely
  gliding in the air without worries. This is because it has no particular
  response animation for the type of attack it is hit with.

Videos:
1, GMG's and Shinobier's instructional video:
        https://youtube.com/watch?v=sMTz7ff6O0Q



"Strange BoA-related death delay"

Enemies killed with BoA have a special death animation in which they usually
split in half or lose some critical body part in a gory fashion.

In some circumstances the enemies will remain alive for up to several seconds
before BoA's special death animation kicks in. During this time, they will
continue to attack Kratos like normal. Afterwards, EXP bonus from BoA's long
combos is also granted.

May happen if:
- Finishing move has a special property like 'launch' or 'knockback'
- If Kratos finishes using magic while BoA is equipped.

Does not happen if:
- Enemy is airborne or downed



"Glitched circle action"

BoA has no throwing/grabbing option, only BoC has. The game gets confused on
this once in a while, and when around mini-game grabbable enemies (with the
circle hovering over their heads), doing a circle attack may cause glitches to
happen. For instance, Kratos can slash the enemy, and after that grab them.

GMG insists on me noting the fact that Kratos may seem to slide towards the
enemy before/during this buffered grab if the enemy has moved away from him
after the attack.



"Artemis tricking" (c: GMG?)

Switching weapons quickly enough, you can make all local enemies stop attacking
you, with only a few exceptions.

Doesn't work on:
- Boss enemies
- Archers of any type
- Minotaur Hammer Grunts and Minotaur Warriors will not stop functioning
  completely. They will switch doing their shockwave-attacks and only them.

Same rules apply for hanging on ledges ("ledge tricking") too.

"Small cutscene loophole" (c: tyrhhjy)

If you jump and do some BoA air attack right before falling into an in-game
cutscene, you'll notice that Kratos takes a step forward after landing. Yes, for
some reason this sequence of moves gives Kratos a frame or two *inside* the
cutscene when he can still do stuff... limited to moving mostly, but he can also
activate nearby prompts.

This actually serves as a time saving strategy before going to Cliffs of
Madness, since you can activate the elevator leading there during Athena's
ramblings. Maybe other spots also exist in the game where this trick could come
in handy.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpLw_g0nbUI



"Air rolls"

In most circumstances, trying to do a roll off a ledge ends the roll
immediately. However, if you do a roll off a ledge during any of BoA's actions,
the roll goes on as if Kratos was on ground - although affected by gravity.

Using Lenient Air Momentum now, you create the illusion of genuine air rolls.

3. Poseidon's Rage

A classic magic from the series in its most overpowered incarnation. Kratos
hops a little in air and a massive circle of lightning starts frying anyone in
the blast radius. You get it from Poseidon near the end of the Aegean Sea.

- Poseidon's Rage lvl. 1 normally always does a fixed amount of hits. But for
  reasons unknown, it can sometimes hit more times than it should. Pressing
  other buttons than circle during the casting may be the catalyst.

- The hit counter is suspended during the time Poseidon's Rage is cast.

- Once you upgrade PR, its radius increases and you can also tap circle to add
  hits during the magic.

- If you upgrade PR while the lightning effect is visible, the magic just cuts
  short, whether on air or on ground.

- PR is a very useful tool for high jumps and also allows an exploit on angled
  surface known as "Poseidon's Jump", as mentioned above.



4. Medusa's Gaze

The first incarnation of what would become a stable in the God of War-series,
some sort of a way to turn your enemies into stone, usually a severed head from
a celebrity Gorgon from Greek mythology. You get this magic from Medusa at the
Gates of Athens.

- Different enemies stonefreeze at different rates. Once an enemy freezes, their
  stoneform has its own HP, usually much less than the normal HP, and depleting
  that makes the enemy shatter. It's basically a quick K.O. that grants you some
  extra red orbs in the process as well, and the most handy way to deal with
  many enemy types in the game.

- Medusa's Gaze doesn't work against Gorgons in this game. Or civilians.

- Gorgon Torrent will cost less magic as you upgrade MG higher.

- Freezing beams are not visibly obstructed by walls, but you still can't freeze
  anything through a wall.

- The normal orb bonus for crushing foes is "Crushed!" that gives you +15 orbs.
  However, there's a separate bonus for crushing flying enemies, "Ruined!",
  that gives you a hefty +30 orbs instead.


- Gorgon Flash is the Lvl. 2 attack of Medusa's Gaze.

- You can shoot both Gorgon Torrent and Gorgon Flash at the same time! This
  in fact increases the rate of an enemy becoming stonefrozen, so it is
  recommended if you just have enough magic.

- If you spam Gorgon Flash in air fast enough, every other blast will not be
  visible.

- You can continue spamming Gorgon Flash in air even after your magic has ran
  out if you just had enough magic for the first Flash.

- Gorgon Rage seems to hit a max. of 9 targets with one blast, and it won't hit
  anything that is below Kratos' vertical level.

- Gorgon Flash and Rage effects remain briefly even over checkpoint retry.


- If you upgrade MG while in the magic's stance, the head disappears from
  Kratos' hands. He then does a sort of glitched Gorgon Flash motion before
  going very stiff. You can still turn around in the magic stance like normal,
  but it looks silly, and you can't use any other Medusa's Gaze attacks than
  Gorgon Rage until you let go of L2, at which point the glitch fixes itself.

- Upgrading in air, Kratos does an useless, invisible Flash shot instead.

- If you start using Medusa's Gaze during game load black-out time, the stance
  you enter is completely immobile - you can't turn in it.



"Gorgon Rage glitch & related material"

You can use a stonefreezing exploit to drop Kratos' family off the map in the
penultimate fight of the game. Sounds strange, right?

At first I noticed this glitch to happen when freezing a large number of Kratos
clones using Gorgon Rage, then hugging the family. Doing this, the family would
slide in a slightly uncomfortable way towards Kratos' direction, and luring them
far enough off to the side, you could drop them into outer space.

At first we thought that this was only possible with Gorgon Rage, but later on,
in the year 2009, Manu918 devised a method to move Kratos' family that only
used Gorgon Torrent. Apparently the only important thing was that plenty of
targets were stonefrozen roughly at the same time, then Kratos' family was
hugged. That was enough to move the family. Wonder what is up with this glitch?

Well, Kratos' family is a very unique prompt. There are no comparable prompts
elsewhere in the game, so it's possible that this glitch only does anything in
the penultimate fight. It's still not been proven or disproven, though.

        http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gd4tfP70J70


Just Gorgon Rage does have an unique effect elsewhere, and that is at the
infamous sex mini-game. After the Rage animation passses, the minigame starts
on its own accord without a separate grab animation at all. The camera angle
changes and the small urn either wobbles or stays put. Kratos stays unoccupied
the whole time. Nothing else happens, or so it seems.

Videos:

5. Zeus' Fury

A projectile-type attack given to you by Zeus at Rooftops of Athens.

- The longest range attack Kratos gets in this game.

- If you spam Zeus' Fury bolts in air fast enough, some blasts may become
  invisible.


- If you upgrade this magic while in its stance, the lightning effects disappear
  from Kratos' hands and he can't shoot any bolts. The glitch fixes itself once
  you let go of L2.

- Upgrading it in air, Kratos shoots one invisible bolt of ZF instead.


- A charged Zeus' Fury shot costs more magic than normal. But you can create a
  charged shot as long as you have enough magic for a normal ZF shot, which is
  a small advantage.

- If you shoot Zeus' Fury from far enough away, your enemies do not think to
  block the shots. An useful fighting exploit in some cases.


"Fury Rush", a movement tactic

You can move quickly with continuous Hermes Rush spam by doing a precise input
where you alternate between R2 (Zeus' Fury), L1 (Hermes Rush) and X (cancel
Rush). The problem is that this movement is too precise to be done reliably
in an RTA. You need to be holding R2 when pressing X to cancel Hermes Rush or
else Kratos jumps, which slows you down. Yet you want to be holding R2 as little
as possible since Kratos does not move while aiming with ZF. Overall, it's
probably a fun addition to tool-assisted runs, if nothing else.

6. Army of Hades

The last magic Kratos gets in this game, from Hades at the end of his Challenge.


- Casting AoH in air, it's easy to accidentally cancel the magic by landing on
  ground too early with Kratos. Fortunately you don't lose magic until the
  actual souls fly out and the effect begins, so you don't lose anything this
  way. Not to mention the ensuing slowdown is the biggest in the game, helping
  with "Lenient Air Momentum" if you know how to harness it.

- The AoH souls remain around Kratos even over FMVs and changing areas. This
  exploit allows you to take the souls to Ares 3, for example, where it's not
  possible to cast magic for a slight advantage.

- The souls cease to target or attack anything whenever time is stopped (for
  example during a cutscene).

- Using Army of Hades on stonefrozen enemies will reduce their actual HP, not
  their stone form's HP. This means that you can get the minigame circle appear
  on these creatures. You can't do the minigame while they're stoned, though...

- Upgrading AoH while the magic is on causes the effect to end and all the souls
  instantly disappear.

- If you upgrade Blades and AoH and then retry and attempt to cast AoH, the game
  will likely crash.




I. Enemy glitches:
------------------

"Enemy out of bounds"

The game has set strict limits for your enemies to wander, for various level
design reasons. Some of these limits are extremely obvious and exploitable.
For example getting on a ladder can cause every enemy in the room to forget
your presence. And when leaving an area, the enemies often act as if there was
an invisible wall separating them from Kratos, and they will not follow him to
wherever the path next leads.

Rarely the game allows you to send an enemy outside of his regular bounds,
causing the A.I. to go wild. They run against walls, hoping to get back to
the correct area, in vain. Depending on how some areas are loaded and drawn,
you may encounter a phenomena of invible enemies during this kind of out of
bounds moment. You can hear the enemies, but can only see or damage them from
certain parts of the room. It's funny to look and listen at, and it can
sometimes be useful too. Air throwing or just launching enemies to strange
places can get this to work - though be warned that it's very rare.

Credits go to the Max Upgrade Guide at GameFAQs, that's where I first heard
about this glitch. Check it out for more detailed info.

Infinite orb fountain v3 is possible utilizing out of bounds limits, albeit in
a more limited form than it was in GoW II. Read the below section for more info.

"Infinite red orbs"

The classic infinite red orb glitch involves the death animation of an enemy
becoming stuck so that they will give up their red orbs over and over again.
You need to have the animation interrupt and reset right after the orbs fly
free but before the animation naturally ends. This can happen f.e. if the
enemy falls on some strange piece of collision which can't accomodate its
death throes, like a crooked surface or a ladder. 

The best enemy to do this with is the harpy: they're small and weak,
they fly, they have a quick, stable death animation. I've never seen a large
enemy get fountained. Once a minotaur bounced strangely from a wall and it
gave two times the orbs, but that was hardly a fountain of any kind.

The best known places where this works are the infamous Challenge of Atlas
ladder, and the Harpy area at Temple of the Oracle. In the Harpy room you
can use the statues to create makeshift cramped spots for the Harpies to die
in, giving a variable amounts of infinite red orbs in the process.

There exist other type of infinite orb glitches too. Infinite orbs glitch v3
is basically causing some enemy to unload during their death animation by
going too far away from them. Approaching them again resets their death
animation, and as expected, causes them to give up multiple times the orbs.
This variation needs a specific type of a level design weakness to work, and
as of now there are no really good, easy examples of where to do this glitch
in the original God of War. It's a different case in God of War II for example.

You can also create infinite red orbs by luring an enemy close to a save point,
then killing them at the same time as you create a new checkpoint by examining
the save. This is easy to do at Chamber of the Crystal Eye and the Legionnaires
that start hanging out there later in the game. This can be combined with
stonefreezing and shattering to make the orb gain more efficient, but the
timing becomes harder as well.

"Generally about enemies"

- Many enemies can be air grabbed again and again until they die. A big
  weakness. In a similar way, many enemies can be Orion's Harpooned to death
  by just repeating the move indefinitely. The particular weaknesses of each
  enemy is listed at the enemy-specific section.

- During grappling or rope sections, your enemies can do a very glitched
  looking grab on Kratos. Because of lack of space, their animation becomes
  juxtaposed somewhere away from Kratos and it almost seems as if they're
  climbing a ladder. If the grab ends against Kratos's favor, the enemy might
  disappear for no reason afterwards.

- No one knows why or how, but some legionnaires with a circle looming above
  their heads will remain impossible to grab (causing "false grabs" of sort)
  with the exception that Kratos will not get shunned back when he attempts to
  grab them. This means the false grab can be spammed and it looks strange, to
  say the least.

- Enemies' attacks stun other enemies but will not do any damage... with the
  exception of stonefrozen enemies, who can shatter accidentally by friendly
  fire.

- Some enemies can be attacked for extra hits even after they're dead (before
  they disappear).

- During a grappling section, if a legionnaire is in air (e.g. while jumping
  between chasms), he can be launched very high in air with any move that hits
  several times in a quick succession (Poseidon's Rage, Cyclone of Chaos).



"General grab and throw glitches"

- Doing throws over uneven surface will usually cause both Kratos and his
  enemy to rise up in air for the throw's duration. If the height difference
  between Kratos and enemy is too big, the grab cancels out disappointingly.
  Sometimes Kratos acts out the grab/finishing move without actually holding
  the enemy, e.g. trying to rip head off nothingness while the Gorgon is
  frolicking somewhere nearby.

- At least in a few spots during the game, grabbing a spawning legionnaire will
  cause another legionnaire in the room slide long ways away - try it for
  example after getting Poseidon's Rage and enemies appear. I wonder what
  causes it...

- GMG says that after having grabbed an archer and doing the 360 degree toss
  to it, a Cursed Legionnaire grabbed Kratos. Strangely, Kratos dropped the
  Archer and began grabbing the healthy Legionnaire instead (who was instantly
  brought down to 'O'.) Some sort of mix-up inside the game.



"Shoddy A.I."

- In some corridors, you may find one of your enemies walking plainly against
  a wall, usually towards where Kratos is. I've seen this happen in at least 3
  different locations, though always with those legionnaire-types.

- In Challenge of Atlas your enemies (Fallen Legionnaires) will try to climb
  a normal ladder to get to you. Unfortunately their behaviour has a loophole
  in it and they get stuck in the middle if you quickly change elevation. If
  you try to climb the ladder again, they turn normal again.



Enemy-specific glitches (and additional info):

Thanks go to GMG for most of this stuff. Entries with no important info to
mention are omitted.


-- Undead Archer --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon.

- Is not fooled by BoA or ledge tricking.


-- Cursed Archer --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon.

- Is not fooled by BoA or ledge tricking.

- The area effect from explosive arrows can't be blocked.

- Melee-counter version of their arrow will not explode, but if it misses, it
makes the sound of an explosive arrow.

- They will never melee-counter as long as an unexploded explosive arrow is
sizzling in the vicinity.

- Rarely, deflected explosive arrows do not explode.

- If an explosive arrow hits and shatters something petrified, the arrow sticks
in mid-air until it explodes.

- In unknown circumstances an arrow can get stuck in mid-air, still "mobile",
turning towards Kratos if he's moving around it.

- Arrows have a tendency to break all sorts of grab moves which would otherwise
be unbreakable.


-- Hades Archer --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon.

- Is not fooled by BoA or ledge tricking.

- Basically just a Cursed Archer with a triple arrow shot.



-- Centaur --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- Glitch "O" when grabs are interrupted *it's fake/a trap*

- Their shockwave's range is larger than the effect would show.

- Their arrows make it very easy for them to drop Kratos out of air.

- Sometimes, after they've loaded an arrow but haven't used it for some reason,
the arrow stays in their hand for some time and looks uncouth. This extends
to even them physically attacking Kratos with an arrow loaded and flashing.

(This is what GMG had to say about this matter: "The 'arrow in hand' thing
may not be a glitch but rather an augment to their physical strikes. If it
is a glitch, it is a blessing because it makes it obvious they CANNOT use
their Stomp (Shockwave) while it is out like that.")

- If their death grab gets interrupted, they'll instantly grow back a new pair
of legs and continue attacking you.



-- Cerberus Breeder --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- Occassional failure to fire during its 3x fireball attack.


-- Cerberus Offspring --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and OH.

- They can do glitch growths even after their deaths.

- OH will sometimes fail for no reason (maybe because of the small size?)

- Grabs will also sometimes fail for no reason.



-- Cyclops Enforcer --

- Just the furthest half of the spinning ball attack hits. You can stand in the
rope or back half without taking a hit.

- Just walking *slowly* around it counter-clockwise is sufficient to avoid all
hits (perhaps not the rush though).


-- Cyclops Brute --

- Grabs don't always connect when they should.


-- Cyclops Desert King --

- Doesn't have a 'Brutal/Ruthless Kill bonus'.



-- Gorgon --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon.

- Chance for air grab high jump. (read more in the section of high jumps)


-- Medusa --

- Has 10000 HP, which is a lot. The mini-game needed to dispose of her becomes
available a lot sooner, and the player is expected to deal with her that way.
If you instead defeat her by draining all her HP, the game becomes stuck.



- Harpy --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon, as are all other harpies.

- Subject to orb fountain glitches, as are all other harpies.



-- Undead Legionnaire --

- There are countless of glitches ready for these guys, mainly because they
appear at so many different circumstances (e.g. ropes and grapple sections too)
and places. Almost all have already been mentioned at the above sections.


-- Cursed Legionnaire --

- Some of them can not be minigamed - the circle does not appear above their
heads.

- Rarely these enemies can be infinitely Orion's Harpooned, allowing you to do
a 1000 hit combo with ease.

- Can climb ladders, though not very well. In the places they do it, they tend
to get stuck and their A.I. won't work very well.

- If two of them are very close on a rope, a kick hits both.

- The Legionnaire is invincible for a moment when the mini-game circle is about
to appear. I hear you can throw the Legionnaire even through water surface at
this time without it dying.

- Subject to air grab high jump when "O" is about to appear.


-- Magic Legionnaire --

- These are the Legionnaire-type enemies with shields on them. Just to note,
any explosive move will destroy their shields, including Rising Helios and
Lance of the Furies. The sole exception to this rule is the Blades' plume or
Spirit attack during Rage of the Gods (which is a glitch).

- While they are airborne, downed or spawning, their shields do not stop hits.
Physical hits at any such point make it possible to do a grab through their
shields.

- Throws towards Magic Legionnaires can either cause a knockback or be
deflected. GMG theorizes knockback occurs more often if the opponent is right
in front of the throw.

- Some of them can be grabbed like normal despite they have their shields in
some slightly special conditions, e.g. having taken a thrown legionnaire to
their face or possibly just having got damaged enough. This kind of grab is
glitched-up, causing Kratos to slide erratically across the playing field for
short ways. With this movement you can f.e. hit the spike crushers at Temple
of the Eye through a solid wall. Also, if you choose to throw your enemy
somewhere, its graphics will twitch a bit, and in some cases it will even die
before it is thrown.

- Some RotG BoC attacks act like their shield isn't there, as does AoH.

- You don't have a way to get past their shields with only BoA.

- Charged Zf bolts' area blast can hit them even with their shield intact, but
it does no damage.

- If a Magic Legionnaire has lost its shield, and is then petrified (but manages
to break free), it may start acting as if it had a shield again.

- If one dies with its shield intact, the lone shield can stay a while after
the Legionnaire's corpse has disappeared.


-- Legionnaire Captain --

- Would otherwise be subject to Infinite Air Grab (and possibly Infinite OH),
but their minigame prompts mess the whole thing up.

- They have a strange tendency to block Zf bolts while downed, as if their guard
was up.

- "It REGENERATES 10HP everytimes you let it recover from "O"." - GMG



-- Minotaur Grunt --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- If you do a mini-game to it that cuts off in the middle (because of height
difference for example), its axe may disappear permanently. Just a graphical
glitch.


-- Minotaur Hammer Grunt --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- Uses the shockwave attack when you are abusing the ledge.


-- Minotaur Warrior --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- Uses the shockwave attack if you try ledge tricking.


-- Minotaur Tormentor --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab.

- BoA Homerun trick "Punt" typically (if done fast) will send them the opposite
direction that is desired.

- Artemis often cannot block their shoulder rush unless your guard was up early.



-- Satyr --

- I hear air grabs done to them actually deal no damage for some reason.

- BoA Homerun trick "Spike" causes an unusual knockback/bounce effect to Satyrs.
Very useful in Challenge of the Gods 10.

- Their "aerial recovery" allows immunity from "Homerun" but not "Punt". (read
more in the section about BoA glitches.)



-- Temple Siren --

- Subject to Infinite Air Grab and Orion's Harpoon.

- If petrified when dizzy, the Siren goes into wandering mode again but her
health doesn't regenerate - the mini-game circle will remain over her head
indefinitely. Now OH and air grabs won't connect to her for some reason, and
juggles won't work either.

If the Siren has 19 HP left, normally grabbing her causes the non-fatal grab
animation and leaves her with 9 HP, preventing the possibility of doing a grab
finisher to her. If grabbed at 18-11 HP, the Siren just glitch dies instead.
If grabbed at 10 HP or less, the non-fatal grab is skipped and a finisher is
used instead.


-- Desert Siren --

- They die when petrified 3 times in a quick succession.

- They have 10000 HP, which is a lot. In fact, even their petrified state has
10000 HP! The mini-game needed to dispose of them becomes available a lot
sooner, and the players are expected to deal with them that way.



-- Wraith of Athens --

- Subject to Infinite Orion's Harpoon.

- Kratos' grab can launch several Wraiths in the air when it resolves.


-- Desert Wraith --

- Subject to Infinite Orion's Harpoon.

- Their air grab sometimes breaks for no apparent reason.



-- Pandora's Guardian --

See the level-specific glitches further down...



-- Evil Kratos, Agony --

- The Kratos clone with Zeus' Fury.

- Agony only attacks Kratos but because of the line of fire, he may hit the
family accidentally. Though his bolts are relatively weak, they can devastate
by breaking your control of the fight.

- Agony kills don't count towards the kill count in the Kratos clone fight.


-- Evil Kratos, Remorse --

- The Kratos clone with Blades of Chaos. They can also grab Kratos.


-- Evil Kratos, Regret --

- The Kratos clone with Blade of Artemis. For some reason they can also do the
special attacks only Blade of the Gods has!


-- Ares --

See the level-by-level specifics for the final boss fight.




4. Glitch playthrough (level-specific glitches)
-----------------------------------------------

Different categories are these:

- Sequence break: a trick to skip some part of the game.
- Collision flaw: some noteworthy oddity in the collisions.
- Out of bounds: an alternative term for a collision flaw, allows going OoB.
- Trigger skip: skipping some noteworthy trigger in a level.
- A.I. glitch: includes blind spots and other level-specific A.I. oddities.
- Swimming glitch: anything related to swimming glitching.
- Other: more unspecified glitches.
- Strategy: some pointers for battles, etc. Not necessarily glitches.
- Random: just some small piece of interesting info, not a glitch.



Pre-game:
---------

Other: If you press up or down at some frame before the main menu has loaded
and appeared, the text of "new game" is smudged under "load game". This effect
disappears once you choose to do anything in the menu.


Random (PS2): in-game cheat code

It was discovered by Wulf2k9 in 2020 that there exists a secret in-game cheat
code in God of War that allows you to unlock secrets in the main menu or all
the weapons during gameplay early. It only works on the original PS2 version
and not the HD Collection.

Videos:
1, wulf2k9's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVNNWpzxK0



Aegean Sea:
-----------

Strategy: Enemies are reluctant to approach or attack if Kratos goes into the
upper-left corner of the first room (past the floor entrance).


Random: The FMV of the floor entrance opening and new enemies flooding out will
not happen if Kratos is too close to the floor.


Other: it's possible to go out of bounds from the second room in the game by
trying to jump back where you dropped down from with Apollo's High Jump.

But it's unlikely you can do anything useful with this info since there doesn't
seem to be much floor out of bounds, and you don't have lv. 2 Blades at this
point anyway in most normal circumstances.


Speed strategy: you can do a bit of early damage to first Hydra by attacking as
it is approaching. On the category any% NG+ this allows a speed kill of Hydra
where it doesn't even get a single attack in before it faints.


Other: Mini-game glitches

If you attack the first Hydra head at a wrong time when its health is depleted,
it will not become stunned. Instead, it revives and goes back to normal as soon
as the tutorial message telling you about mini-games is closed. I hear this can
happen the other way around too, so that the Hydra goes into mini-game stun
right as it should normally regain consciousness.

Another mini-game glitch is that if your minigaming grab contacts with Hydra
right before the tutorial message about the minigame comes up, and you fail the
mini-game, Hydra is then suspectible to become stunned again with just one hit.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of the one-hit Hydra stun
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bz0cq-c_o#t=172


Strategy: It is possible to damage kill the first Hydra head. You need to either
do tons of damage to it during the time it is stunned before it revives - you
pretty much need Easy-mode and a bonus costume for this to be possible - or use
the first mini-game glitch mentioned above to slowly chip away at Hydra's health
until you finally are able to damage kill it.

Collision flaw: inside Hydra

"Not sure if it's known, but it's possible to breach the wall of collision
infront of this Hydra, I once did it by accident. I quickly rolled to the
barrels & the Hydra smashed me into them, Kratos was flung awkwardly and I
ended up underneath the Hydra, with the camera inside its body. At the time I
tried to go up the stairs to reach the balance beam, but I just ended up back
in front of the Hydra. I should have tried to high jump to the beams. Might be
worth exploring this?" - Findlestick


Other / speed strat?: there's a small invisible ledge almost beneath the
doorway that leads to the next map. You can clear the balancing beam section
over shallow water by swimming under the exit, then grabbing the ledge and
from there jumping on the balancing beams. It's unknown if this is actually
faster than doing this section using the beams.

Other: "Petrifying the Harpies and the Archers on the Ship causes them to
un-exist immediately after getting petrified. Course, you need a cheat to have
MG on the ship >__>." - Demonic Phoenix


Swimming glitch: only possible with cheats so far, but for the sake of
completion, here is some swimming glitch exploration from Aegean Sea. If you
have the Trident and the capability to infinite jump, you can start swimming
glitch from the puddle in the same room where there's the self-caged man who
you can talk to.

To note, if you complete Aegean Sea while swimming, you'll get stuck soon after
when reaching Port of Athens because you can't leave the ship innards while
swimming.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's vid of Aegean Sea swimming exploration
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhwCs0xzdhU


Random: in case you were curious, if you work hard enough for it, you can get
Lv. 2 Blades as early as at the chest before 2nd Hydra with Tycoonius-costume.


Camera glitch: After kicking the door open to the second Hydra's room, start
walking towards the door and progress onward slowly. The camera will eventually
forcefully turn around while the rest of the scenery disappears for an instant.


Trigger skip: Skippable door trigger before second Hydra

If you run by the left-hand wall into the large area with harpies and
eventually the second Hydra head, the red wall which would enclose the
only exit does not activate - you avoid the door trigger. This has no use
unless you want to play around with the second Hydra head by leaving the fight
prematurely. It just keeps attacking as if Kratos was near it...


Sequence break: skipping second Hydra

A long rumored skip, but it's true... you can skip the second Hydra. First,
open one of the compartments for chests at the back of the arena. Jump inside
and wait. Be ready to jump outside and block a Harpy when one is trying to
attack you. This occasionally causes the Harpy to end up on the above level,
to the wrong side of the railing. The most important thing is that you block
the Harpy while high enough in air... but after that you need some luck for the
Harpy to fly to the correct direction, over the railing.

After the Harpy is over the railing, get out of the compartment, do an
ascension and try to air grab the Harpy. The grab will cut off because of the
collision in the way, but instantly jump and try to grab the Harpy again.
You'll gain enough height to get over the railing here.

This is not a difficult skip, but it takes luck to do it fast. Also, you'll
miss out on the orbs that Hydra 2 would drop, so consider that too.

An alternative way to skip this boss exists, but it requires you to enter the
tight space between the rightmost chest and the wall, which is no trivial task
(unless you have Lv. 2 Blades and Hermes Rush). Your best bet for doing this
at will is to block Harpy attacks in air at the back of the chest compartment.
After ending up in the cramped space, attempt to do sideways rolls against the
chest to have Kratos start flicker oddly and slowly sink inside ground.
Eventually he may fall through to the water tunnel beneath, but this is not a
given since the collision works pretty strangely. All in all it is easier to
use the first method to skip the 2nd Hydra. (c: satvara)

2, satvara's vid of the second method:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui48nm2PNGs


Collision flaw: Entering the second Hydra

If you roll just the right moment towards the spot where the Hydra appears,
and somehow manage to stay in that area after it has emerged (e.g. by jumping 
in air at a correct time), you've entered the second Hydra. You're inside its
collisions. Unfortunately this is useless, because it can still attack you
from where you are. You can't skip the fight itself because the hole in the
floor is purely cosmetic until the creature is gone.

The easiest way to try this out is retrying again and again from the pre-fight
checkpoint.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4scwgmQqc6g#t=35


Other: in rare instances the second Hydra emerges from the ground too early and
the game still has some Harpies and sailors running around during the boss
fight. They unload maybe 15 seconds into the encounter, but still pretty cool.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bz0cq-c_o#t=203


Other: Small glitch at the short grapple section after second hydra

If you move/jump towards the right side of the wall while grappling, you may
activate this glitch. Whenever you press down, Kratos turns 180 degrees around
and climbs with his back against the wall. It's just a graphical glitch.

While you're at this grapple section, try to grab the legionnaires on the deck
while grappling. You get a glitched grab move.


Speed strategy: hop past the pole section instead of slowly walking.


"Shipwrecked Vessel" - save point


Other: box spawning oddities

You can destroy the box with your own hands and be a witness to how a new one
miraculously appears each time.

- The box will try to slide away from Kratos's position if you're standing in
  the spot where it is spawning.
- It's possible for you to enter the box. R2'ing it now will cause Kratos to
  move away from the box for about one boxes length, strangely. I'm not sure
  if Kratos could continue holding on to the box like this (in a glitched way)
  since the message interrupts your grab hold.
- A box can spawn slightly inside the ground. It automatically breaks shortly.


Other: occasionally the tutorial message of examining the box doesn't come.
This may have to do something with Kratos' turning while examining it, but it's
too hard to control at will to be a speed strat.


Sequence break: skip block pushing

This skip appears to only be possible on the PS3 HD Collection. Do a basic high
jump towards the climbing wall, and with nearly frame precise timing, you'll
make the jump and are able to continue on your way without using the box.

Remember that to get maximum height out of your ascension, do not buffer the
air square attack during the ascension. Instead wait until you're at the very
top of the ascension before manually inputting air square attack.

A.I. glitch: Archers at the box moving "puzzle"

If, after activating the cutscene where the archers are threatening the ship
crew, you leave the area and go back where you met the first Hydra head and then
come back, the archers aren't shooting at all anymore. GMG reports that their
A.I. is completely shut off, making them non-reactive to anything done to them.


Sequence break: Skipping PR and big Hydra boss (c: satvara)

Climb the large mast. At the top, use the balance beam to go to either left or
right for about 8 steps. Now, when you jump down, you'll fall out of bounds to
the area below. There isn't much floor there, but if you're precise, you can
land while remaining out of bounds. From there you can inch your way until you
finally reach behind the locked door, therefore skipping PR, fighting the big
Hydra and getting the cabin key.

This skip is precise, but still reliable enough to be done in a RTA. Personally
it's easier to do the first jump from the left side because the camera is more
clear during the jump. For hitting the railing at the edge without falling down
to your doom, try to align Kratos with one of the ropes of the ship.

Even after landing on the railing there is another tricky part ahead. The floor
is even more unstable close to the cabin, so you can't afford to go too far
from the ship's edge. But at the same time, it's very easy to slip back in
bounds too. You should do a very careful double jump to get from on top of the
railing closer to the cabin door, letting go of L-stick early to prevent Kratos
from running back in-bounds during the jump.

After that you still have to jump in-bounds to reach the area behind the locked
door. There is practically no floor in that area out of bounds, so your double
jump has to be very precise. Personally I find it easier to have Kratos jump on
top of the rising part of the railing first to be able to do a longer double
jump that doesn't have to be as precise. Just be careful not to slip back in
bounds while getting on the railing.

By itself this skip saves around 5-6 minutes in real time, compared to a well
made speedrun, depending on the category of course. You'd imagine skipping PR
would be problematic in a speedrun, but with new route breakthroughs it is less
of an issue nowadays. Medusa's Gaze works for most combat situations very well,
and meanwhile most skips can be done with BoA Flash jumps and don't need PR.

It can be reached with an Apollo's Long Jump from the middle of the mast.

"The Hydra Attacks" - save point


Wasted potential: there's a moveable checkpoint right before the Big Hydra
fight. Unfortunately you can't move the checkpoint past a certain height on the
climbing wall - if you could, you could skip the intro with black-out time.

It's unknown if you could use load game black-out time to skip this cutscene.
But even if you could, it would be very difficult... and probably pointless
because you probably couldn't finish the Hydra fight like that.


Other: Big Hydra disappears

If you have Lv. 2 Blades and use Apollo's Ascension high jump to reach the
climbing wall from higher than you should be able to, you skip a trigger that
would make the Big Hydra load. You can fight the small Hydras as usual, but
nothing special happens after climbing the mast. You have to go back and hit
the missing loading trigger to bring Big Hydra into the fray as well.

Another thing the skipped trigger did was to block access to the lower parts
of the ship. So, since you didn't hit the trigger, you are able to return to
the place you got PR from during the Hydra fight. Parts of the small Hydra
heads are protruding through the ceiling, and you can try to fight them from
here if you want. Be warned that they can still hit you, though, despite you
being far under them.

Graphical: the Hydra health bars are prone to strange glitches. They overlap
any messages you may get, looking messy. Also, if you go into menus with a
message active, the Hydra health bars will carry on into the menus too!


Sequence break: Skipping the small Hydra heads

It's possible to climb up to the big Hydra without bothering with the two
smaller heads. Do a sideways ascension against the ropes followed by PR.
The Hydras will now try to knock you down, but they will only manage to
interrupt your PR, and at this point you can continue climbing up the ropes.
For some reason it's critical that you do the ascension sideways and not
straight towards the ropes or else the Hydras will notice Kratos much more
often when he tries to climb to the top and knock him off regardless. Some
delay after being interrupted and continuing climbing the mast can also help
with the Hydras not bothering you. (c: Tyrhhjy)

There also exists a rare variation where you fool both of the small Hydra
heads into not intercepting Kratos without using PR. It involves messing
with their heads by jumping down and then returning, or so it seems. But it's
more worth it to just use the above method in a run to skip the Hydra heads.

Camera glitch: camera focuses on a small Hydra head

When a small Hydra head faints, the camera concentrates on it for a moment. By
doing unknown things there and then, the camera will not depart from the KO'd
head and return to Kratos. This is completely harmless, only happened to me
once - while doing an infinite jump and being quite far away from the head.

Collision flaw: the falling platforms during the big Hydra fight

If you're on one while one rises, you can easily drop through it. Also,
you can manage to have one fall on you. Both of these instances are useless,
just simple lapses in collision.


Other: Getting stuck inside the grapple wall

This is completely useless, but at least unique. Jump to the grapple wall, then
lean towards either side of it (so that Kratos looks like he's preparing to
jump). Then do a grab or strong hit, etc. If the small Hydra's mast knockdown
attack hits Kratos at a correct time, he will get stuck torso halfway inside
the ropes for good and you have to retry.

Strategy: Small Hydra's swipe move will not reach between the 12 and 3 o'clock
position, leaving a big opening. (GMG's tip)


Other: Tendency to freeze during the big/any Hydra fight

It's happened to me once or twice, and I've heard several other people complain
about this too. The screen goes black but you still see the boss health meter at
the screen's lower half. The music continues playing, but nothing you do will
evoke a reaction in the game. You must restart if this happens.


Speed strategy: if you retry after reaching the Big Hydra, it skips bellowing
at Kratos and goes straight to attacking him instead, saving a few secs. But
beware that if you retry too early, you are sent back to an earlier checkpoint
instead, wasting a lot of time.


Speed strategy: if you grab big Hydra at the earliest possible moment after
it is knocked down, it has no time to regenerate its health and you can do the
mini-games to it almost back to back. This is a helpful tactic in a God-mode
speedrun, saving at least 30 seconds. (c: satvara)

However, I haven't tried this trick personally yet. There might be more to it,
in which case the description should be updated. ยง

       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcwg6I1yDR0


Speed strategy: on Easy / Tycoonius category, it's possible to "damage kill"
big Hydra and skip all but the last mini-game of the fight. Have Lv. 2 Blades,
then activate RotG and use the triangle combo to deplete all the health from
the boss. Good timing on your hits saves even more time. After that, the boss
goes straight to the final mini-game, saving a lot of time in the process.

Videos:
1, exe's RTA where this trick is used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtekevR9vA0#t=455


Other: it's possible to bring Big Hydra into the last minigame in a slightly
glitched manner, so that any additional attacks reset the pre-minigame animation
where the Hydra lowers its head, causing it to start over each time. There isn't
much info on how this glitch gets started, but once it happened after doing an
air attack to Hydra as it did its mast chomping attack.


Random: Moving/attacking inside Hydra's mouth cavity will cause blood spatters.


Sequence break: you can skip getting the key from the Fisherman and thus skip
a little navigation and two cutscenes. Just have to visit inside Hydra's throat
to hit a loading trigger and then do a long jump to the exit rope - you probably
needs Lv. 2 Blades for this.

Unfortunately after that you have to go around the locked cabin door the same
way when doing the PR skip. All this should save a little bit of time in the
end, but it makes things more complicated. Probably not worth it if you are
going for in-game time.


Wasted glitch potential: it seems difficult to skip the short in-game cutscene
that you see after Kratos has got the Cabin key and you step outside again. The
cutscene trigger extends as if to form a box around Kratos, so it's not easy to
get around it with jumps.

Exiting the area straight down (using a floor breach under the fallen mast) can
skip the cutscene (?), but it's so slow that you won't win any time doing it.

Video:
1, AKheon's vid of exiting to lower floor:
       http://youtube.com/watch?v=iH45LPODKuU


Speed strategy: You can unlock the cabin door at the same time you get the
prompt to do so. This saves a couple of seconds.



Port of Athens
--------------

Other: sex-mini game glitch

If you try to grab the women from the top left part of the bed, the mini-game
glitches strangely with camera zooming in like it normally does, but with
Kratos completely unattended. Same thing can happen if you utilize Gorgon Rage
in this place, next to the bed. If the mini-game is re-activated during this
camera zoom, it works like normally though the urn moves at wrong times.

Videos:
1, AKheon's short clip of glitching the mini-game with Gorgon Rage:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AujcC1xHI6g


Random: you can talk to the two women with R2 to hear some extra dialogue. For
some reason you can't activate the dialogue while standing on the bed. Also
starting to talk while jumping on to the bed causes the dialogue clips to cut
short for some reason.


"Port of Athens" - save point


Wasted potential: you can do an ascension up the ladder to enter the next area,
but it might not save any time. Not to mention it is hard to do.


Other: go under the water surface

With certain manuevers, you are able to go through the bottom of the ship here
and go underwater. This serves more than one use. But first, let's see how this
trick is done:

The easiest way to do this is to just hold L-stick to the right after having
climbed up the ladder for the first time. There's a cutscene, but eventually
Kratos regains movement, and running to the right he will drop and start hanging
onto a ledge next to the ladder. This way you should get checkpointed while
hanging onto the ledge, and then just retrying causes you to drop underwater.
(c: Satvara)

The reason this trick works is because the ship innards map and the Port map are
two separate maps, and being checkpointed while hanging on a ledge gives you
black-out time during which you fall through map transition trigger. Therefore
after retry you end up underwater in the Port map instead of returning to the
boat innards map.

Another way to end up underwater is by doing a precise jump down the ladder
hole from on top of the ship. There is a very small collision flaw there you
can use to slip past the walls and drop down underwater. With Hermes Stomp this
becomes easier. This variation is seldomly used nowadays, though. (c: satvara)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can also use black-out time glitch to drop
through the map trigger, but there's just no point to do it. A final alternative
is to go under one of the piers near the elevator or the bridge and use LAM to
fall through water surface.

So what's the use of going underwater? Well, you can either cut some corners
while moving through the Port, saving some seconds. Or you can go around the
back of the port and do early swimming glitch. More about that in the next
section.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA6E8QNCQEg


Other: Swimming glitch at Port of Athens (c: satvara)

It just so happens that you can perform functional swimming glitch here, at
Port of Athens. In a speedrun this allows some massive skips in the early parts
of the game. For example, you can start swimming and make your way to the Medusa
room in record time by swimming past all obstacles. Then, you can end swimming
glitch at Medusa by becoming stonefrozen on top of the angled floor in front of
Aphrodite's big face. Pretty nice, huh?

Drop under water surface using one of the methods detailed above and get behind
the map. Go around the fence from the left and move all the way back until
you're literally behind the level. But be careful as the ocean floor will end
eventually, making Kratos fall down.

Behind the map, go about three rolls to the right, so that you are close to the
small hole in the bricks through which you access a bonus area. Walk under that
hole and carefully make your way to the main pathway of the Port, to the area
front of the ship from where you started from. It's especially easy to slip back
in-bounds from here, so avoid the walls to the side. At the very bottom you
come across a wall laid in front of Kratos. Walk towards that wall while slowly
moving to the left to slip through a hole in the collision and continue.

There's a small wooden pathway near the water surface, so target that with an
ascension. Kratos will start swimming under the wooden boards. Now jump and try
diving around this area, especially towards the right. If you did it correctly,
Kratos will start diving and you are free to swim wherever although you don't
even have the Trident yet.

The current fastest way to get back above water surface without swimming glitch
ending is to swim up through the ship's ladder hole from below. Just try to
swim up in front of the ladder and you should be fine. However, you only got
one chance to do this: if you steer to a wrong direction and dive to try it
again, chances are that the game now understands to teleport you inside the
ship innards map. This is very bad if it happens since Kratos cannot leave
that area while swimming! You're stuck and have to retry.

Other: Somewhere inside Port of Athens there's a legionnaire who will not die
from Orion's Harpoon. You can keep Harpooning it again and again, slowly but
surely making a 1000 hit combo. (c: Shinobier?)

Note that the glitched legionnaire will not appear unless you kill the first
bunch of legionnaires that try to attack you in the area.

Videos:
1, Shinobier's video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=SiEeHwXxD5E


Speed strategy: you can use high jump to get to the area with the Phoenix
Feather faster than normal.

Videos:
1, vipeazone style's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqsWILo706I


Other: it's possible to send Legionnaires under the water surface here with
relative ease. If they fall down from air at the same time they become mini-game
grabbable, they won't die but instead fall through water surface. So try things
out with air grabs over water and see what happens. (c: GMG)


Sequence break (swimming): you can un-exist the three Minotaurs fight in a
peculiar way if you're swimming through this area. Start swimming glitch at
the Port and swim upwards to the higher walkway so that you rise through it
at around its middle. Go to the left far enough to hear the Minotaur battle
music start. For some reason the game doesn't show the pre-fight cutscene,
which is even better. Now if you leave this area to the next, the fight simply
disappears from existence and won't activate if you backtrack through here
later.

However, if you try to do this skip in a wrong way, so that the current map
unloads at any point, you get the Minotaur pre-fight cutscene anyway. This is
a time waste and should be avoided.

Also, very rarely, doing this trick may cause the music from the fight to play
in the background indefinitely. Definitely a stressor if it happens in the
middle of a speedrun.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of doing this trick in a RTA:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Ri0BOkthg#t=560


Speed strategy: air grabs are particularly deadly against Minotaurs. Unless
playing under special conditions, like using damage bonus costumes, spamming
air grabs is likely the fastest way to deal with this fight.


Other: the red border which would disappear after beating the Minotaurs will
not do it on the left side until you unload the area and return.



Gates of Athens
---------------

Random: the broken gate can't be examined until you view the intro cutscene
to this area.


Sequence break (swimming): you can avoid starting the Cyclops fight by swimming
around the trigger. Pretty easy.


Speed strategy: killing Cyclops quick

The chasm at the left side of the field is dangerous to the Cyclops. Lure them
right next to it, then run towards them (or attack them when they're facing
you). They will stumble backwards and fall, dying instantly.

Also, by simply running towards the wall near where the grass grows you can
drop the third one before it can even rise up. (c: AKheon)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=z-Wo42I1oEk


Sequence break: getting onto the balcony early (c: Satvara)

Get on the balcony early! This allows you to skip dealing with the Cyclops and
cuts short some navigation before reaching the Medusa-room.

You can high jump on top of the rightmost broken statue near the broken gate.
The top of the statue has angled collision, preventing you from staying on top
of it, but using Poseidon's Rage you can make the game momentarily think Kratos
is on normal ground instead, allowing you to do new jumps and get higher. A
couple of rounds of careful jumping and Poseidon's Rage later, you're high
enough to grab the side of the platform above.

Start by doing a high jump (with PR) towards the middle-right part of the
statue. Jump to get a little further up, then PR as you're landing on the
statue. Hopefully the correct effect took place and Kratos is now able to do
two more jumps while on the statue. So jump and quickly steer towards the right,
but at the end of the jump try to make Kratos face towards left again. You
should try to land somewhere a little to the left of the diagonal "seam" moving
up the statue. PR again. To get the effect happen again is more difficult this
time around, and if it doesn't work, it's most likely your positioning that's
faulty. After that, you should be able to do a double jump and grab the ledge
of the balcony in front of you.

Using this route may very well be faster than going by the Medusa room, even if
you now need to backtrack to Medusa room from the balcony. The bad part is how
precise this trick is, and what makes it especially precarious is that you don't
have regen magic yet, making it a necessity you don't fail in the trick at all.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qBXaC_fwI


Wasted potential: there's some collision in front of the ladder that leads to
the other ballista until you've pushed down the big statue, making it
impossible to high jump there early.


Other: losing control of buttons

"I found this "handicap glitch" after the part where you fight Cyclops for the
first time. I can't remember what exactly I did wrong, but I just couldn't open
any of the chests. In fact, in this part if you go near the gate and press R2
it says something like "there is a bridge on other side". But whenever I pressed
R2 all I heard was the sound you get when you try to powerup abilities you
haven't unlocked yet. ...once I reloaded the nearest save it went fine."
- the_requiem


Speed strat: The ledge on the right side of the large box room can be rolled
over. It's faster than shimmying.


Sequence break: In the same room, don't break any of the boxes but the leftmost.
Then do a high jump on it.


Sequence break: Skipping a small cutscene with pure speed

Right as you enter the room where you acquire Medusa's Gaze, you activate a
cutscene in which the camera pans through the whole room. But if you're quick
enough, you can get past the trigger before it even loads.

Sequence break: skipping Medusa with pure speed

The barrier of Aphrodite's head can be passed before it loads if you do this
area super quick. This way you won't get Medusa's Head or regen magic, though.
Music glitch will make it easier to get this effect since it slows down loading
speed.

Videos:
1, Tyrhhjy's vid:
       unavailable at the time.


Random: Defeating Medusa with pure damage

The actual HP value Medusa has is 10.000, which is extremely high. To activate
the minigame you need a lot less, and that's what virtually every player does
during their playthroughs. If you exceed the 10.000 damage limit, Medusa dies
by herself, and the game doesn't consider it a victory. If you don't know how
to escape the room, you will get stuck there.


Other: Regen magic (c: satvara)

Medusa room. This is the infamous room where you gain regen magic. If you
escape at the correct time, you get to keep it too!

First, kill Medusa. Then, after the Minotaurs spawn, Kratos has regen magic.
Now, at any circumstance do not kill enough Minotaurs by shattering them.
Instead, high jump over the door where Aphrodite's face is, and follow that up
with another high jump to get on top of the room's walls. From there, just
double jump towards the background to reach the next corridor, and voila.

If you use Apollo's Offensive tactfully, you can get out of the room without
even having to use PR and save a little bit of time.

The original method of getting regen magic involved doing a high jump on top
of the box near where you came from, jumping over another wall to go out of
bounds and traversing out of bounds far enough to finally go around Aphrodite's
face blockage. This was pretty hard, since jumping outside bounds is a pretty
unforgiving task in God of War.

        http://youtube.com/watch?v=Dtc_YpAPULs


Strategy: getting early red orbs.

While fighting the Minotaurs in the Medusa room, you have regen magic and an
infinite stream of enemies. You can build up a combo to 1000 quite easily as
many times you want and rack up massive bonuses. Thanks go to keltin_2002's
Max Upgrade FAQ for this nice idea. Check that out for more details.


Other: I've heard that the Minotaur shattering event may glitch up if you
freeze the minotaurs using MG lv. 2 or 3 moves. The event doesn't end like it
should, and you just get stuck (until you escape the room via the roof).
However, this hasn't been tested yet. ยง


Sequence break: now, after getting regen magic and Medusa's Gaze, it is a good
idea to return back to the Port of Athens and re-start swimming glitch. There
is nothing stopping you from swimming directly from here to the Sewers, skipping
everything in between and saving loads of time.

If you skipped PR earlier on in your run, doing this is downright necessary
since you can't do many of the regular skips without PR anyway.


Sequence break: skip the rest of Gates of Athens (c: Satvara)

After the Medusa room, get on top of the high platform which holds one chest.
Get on top of the chest and do a high jump against the right-hand wall - if
correctly performed, Kratos will grab an invisible ledge near the ceiling. Then
jump towards the ladder up ahead. If you were high enough, you missed a loading
trigger, and the outside areas will now never load until you retrace your steps
and touch the trigger. Normally this would be a bad thing, but in this case you
can proceed to do a major sequence break and drop down beyond the broken gate
using a series of blind jumps.

(instructions taken from Wulf2k9's video below)

- You have to go out of bounds from the unloaded area, head back towards the
hallway, then jump on top of the arch.
- You have to do a double jump now. Hold the stick up and left. This will get
you onto the second arch.
- Another double jump. Now hold the stick up.
- After that hold left until you start falling, then immediately hold right
and do Hermes Stomp.

An alternative way is to use Lenient Air Momentum (LAM) to buff your jumping
capabilities and just do one big jump to cross from the corridor you go out of
bounds from to the tunnel below. Keep the exterior areas unloaded as in the
classic variation. Then go out of bounds but stay close to the corridor you came
from. Run to the left for about two and a half steps. Do LAM with Apollo's
Offensive. Start steering diagonally to left and up for less than a second to
get some momentum, then do four AO's, then jump and do five AO's, all the while
steering to that direction. The angle of your jump is the most critical part,
and it's easy to mess up the jump if you get a slightly wrong angle. So, while
you avoid having to do blind platforming, this variation is not entirely
foolproof either. (c: AKheon)

"Fortress of Athens" - save point


Speed strategy: from the balcony with the climbing wall behind you, you can
reach the statue you will later push down quite fast using a jump shortcut.
Do a small long jump on top of the statue's head, and from there do a double
jump more to the right and back to reach the walkway. This is not difficult to
do at all, although the camera may be disorienting at first. Doing this skips
the entire climbing section. (c: Satvara)

Videos:
1, Kewbew's vid of the speed strategy:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxyOBpNff88


Sequence break: Alternative way of skipping Gates of Athens

A slower but easier method of skipping a big portion of Gates of Athens. After
reaching the other end of the climbing wall, you can see an opening in the side
of the gate to your right. That's where you'd later shoot some rope through, but
even now you can use the hole to go inside.

The entire floor near the hole is so-called angled surface. Do a long jump to
reach the angled surface and then use your Gliding skills to move upwards the
collision. Do a Poseidon Jump every now and then to make the process easier
for yourself. Eventually you'll pass through. Now you're inside the Gates while
the inside of the Gate is still mostly unloaded. You can pass through to reach
the exit early... although like in all other versions of this skip, you must
backtrack a bit to hit the loading trigger for the next area, which is upstairs
close to the ladder in front of the door that is banged at. (c: AKheon)

Sequence break (swimming): you can swim around the first Oracle cutscene,
saving over 30 seconds the cutscene normally takes. Fortunately you don't skip
any critical loading triggers doing this.


"Athens Battleground" - save point



Road to Athens
--------------

Sequence break: Passing the pile of rubble

You know the rubble that appears after a short real-time scene where Ares'
fireball destroys a building? It's an obstacle that's pretty high and has some
slippery surface on the top, making Kratos slide off if he tries to jump up it.
It's not exactly the same as your usual angled surface, so it's more difficult
to get over it, but it's not impossible.

Start doing Apollo's Offensive from a running double jump, and you should slide
up the surface instead of sliding down. With a good positioning, you should be
able to get over the obstacle like this.

Other high jump tactics, for instance using PR, can also be used to make the
trick a little easier. Also note that if you don't have MG, doing this skip
is necessary since you can't get through the puzzle room without the magic.

Oh, he also specified that its near the first bend of the road. I haven't
personally seen one, but I'll keep an eye out next playthrough.


Other: The best place in the game to witness the rope momentum glitch. Don't
break the middle barricade, so that you can boost towards it with a rope to a
very lousy effect.

Videos:

Speed strat: Instead of using ropes to cross the chasm after the barricades,
you can do a high jump. It skips the tutorial message that you get if you touch
the rope, saving some real time, at least.



Athens Town Square
------------------

Other: the water puddle at the bottom of the stairs is actual water surface.
If you could reach the water from out of bounds and start swimming in it, you
could use the edges of the pool to push you through the water surface and start
an early swimming glitch... if only.


Fight skip: Skipping the Cyclops fight

There's an invisible ledge to the left before the Cyclops fight and you can
reach it by doing a PR high jump. By going by that route you skip activating
the Cyclops fight. This is kind of unnecessary to do thanks to the next skip,
though.

Videos:

Sequence break: Skipping most of the Athens Town Square

You can reach the balcony with several chests from the large yard by doing a
variation of high jump, "Apollo's High Jump". From there you can just proceed
to Temple of Oracle without doing anything to the "suicide lady" or even
visiting Rooftops of Athens. (c: AKheon)

To speed this variation up, there exists a precise clip through the bridge
railing that you can take advantage of with Hermes Stomp. So, grab the ledge of
the bridge, go a little to right, climb up, do a small hop and HS, that might
work... (c: satvara)

Wasted potential: you can't go around the trigger that makes the lady run away
from you at the balcony because there is a fat sheet of invisible wall in the
way of the next platform until you hit the trigger. Can't just jump there early.


"Athens Town Square" - save point


Sequence break: so, you played through the Greek house and made your way to the
high balcony. Good! It's now possible to do a sequence break that skips
Rooftops of Athens from this place by doing a long jump to the bridge
connecting Rooftops and the next area. The wooden pole in the middle is there,
although still invisible at this stage. (c: Satvara)

You can do this skip without upgrades by hanging onto the out of bounds balcony
ledge from the far right side. But this way you also activate an additional
pre-rendered cutscene that slows you down. (c: Kewbev63)

Videos:
1, Kewbev63's video of the easiest, slowest way of doing this skip:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=91QrJUfRyAs


Wasted potential: Can't access Rooftops of Athens the wrong way

If you get to the bridge early, you can use the elevator that leads you back up
to the Rooftops, but during the trip something will always go wrong. Kratos will
proceed to fall down to his death after some strange camera angles.

Using the elevator with swimming glitch active reveals what really happens:
Kratos actually spawns a few meters below the elevator for some reason. Not an
issue for swimming Kratos. After riding the elevator back and trying again,
things work out like normal from thereon. But this still means that you can't
access the Rooftops from the wrong direction without swimming or some manner
of infinite jump at your disposal.


Strategy: The first Magic Legionnaires you encounter inside the Greek house have
very little moving room before they consider themselves out of bounds. Sweet
spots are easy to find and abuse.


Strategy: If you don't kill any enemies on your revisit to the Greek house, only
1 of the 4 archers in the final stretch of the area appear.


Random: Athens Town Square civilians

They are like headless chickens. They sometimes appear in clusters, running
against a wall or a corner at the exactly same direction. They can't be beamed
stonefrozen, I wonder why.


Sequence break: getting to the tunnel early

You can do an "Apollo's High Jump" from on top of the balcony to go over the
wall, and from out of bounds carefully jump to the Tunnel Passage without having
to use the trap door to get there. However, you still need to pick up the key or
the Tunnel won't load.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid of this and other shenaningas:
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_CPSTZYXg


Random: you can grab a ledge on the pathway leading to the hatch and move
under the wooden bridge on either side of it. Looks silly, that's all.


"Tunnel Passage" - save point


Wasted potential (swimming): from tests, it seems hard to access Rooftops from
the direction of the tunnel with swimming glitch on. The loading trigger is
inside the corridor (before the last gate) where it can be theoretically hit
while swimming, but not easy. Should be tested again at some point. ยง



Rooftops of Athens
------------------

Speed strategy: You can skip the short tutorial about climbing by jumping to
the other side of the vines right before the spot where the tutorial begins.

Wasted potential: it's possible to go past the Wraiths intro FMV with black-out
time, but doing is not useful since the next area won't load that way. However,
it looks interesting how there is a rampaging Ares quite close amidst unloaded
blackness as you are hanging onto the vine pillars...

Fight skip: after the Wraith intro FMV, if you're quick enough you can just
roll past the red fight barrier before it forms. (c: satvara?)

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_CPSTZYXg#t=111


Camera flaw: before the vine jump section with four archers, if you jump heavily
to the right, you may activate a strange camera angle which shows the whole area
from a far-away isometric angle. Most of the objects in the area are not drawn
with this view, and it looks a bit strange.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJP3uQsN-Mk#t=10


"Treasure Room" - save point


Sequence break: you can get inside the Zeus' Fury room early, skipping the
entire ballista pushing part! From Treasure Room, climb up the ladder. Now some
enemies should approach Kratos and the camera will change. Do a double jump,
grabbing the roof's southern ledge. Inch your way to as right on the ledge as
you can before falling down, then do a basic long jump (use air square attacks
in between your double jump). You should fall down on some invisble collision.
Following that to the right, you'll eventually fall down inside the Zeus' Fury
room. (c: satvara)

It's not properly loaded at first, and touching the lightning icon in front of
the exit does nothing. But if you roll a little down the corridor and return,
things should load like normal... voila, Zeus' Fury early.

Videos:

Other: if you drag the ballista towards some of the urns, it will freak out
and zip long distances.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bz0cq-c_o#t=232


Strategy: You can defeat the archers on the ceiling without Zeus' Fury with PR.
(thanks for Riningan to reminding)


Sequence break/other: sparing the cowardly soldier (c: satvara)

You can long jump over the chasm that has the cowardly soldier refusing to pull
the switch. First grab the ledge opposite to the large chasm you're supposed to
cross to get a better starting momentum. Then jump, instantly afterwards do
Apollo's Offensive x2, then a normal square attack, then another jump that is
followed by another Apollo's Offensive. That should be enough.

So, what to do on the other side? Well, you spared the poor sod's life for now.
In theory this also means that it's possible to skip Zeus' Fury, even if you
decided to play through this area and not skip it altogether using the Town
Square skip. Pretty neat.

The soldier can be hit with most of your attacks, prompting him to die and the
door to collapse as if you had shot him with a Zeus' Fury bolt like intended.
Unfortunately if Kratos is in front of the gate, he too will get slaughtered by
this mysterious invisible force, although it can also be blocked. The soldier
can't be stonefrozen or grabbed, but otherwise anything works.

As for the closed gate, it is fortunately brittle and breaks if you just keep
attacking it. It's much tougher than other breakable walls, but it's no
surprise: you were never supposed to break it by hand like this anyway.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_CPSTZYXg#t=150


Random: the corner of water as you're heading towards the elevator is real
water surface. It remains to be seen if this knowledge can be put to use...


Other: you can roll off the elevator button very precisely to activate it but
not be on it when it starts descending. This doesn't signify anything, though,
Kratos gets safely to his destination anyway.


Random: the puddles after you get out of the elevator are not real water
surface.


"Return to Town Square" - save point
note: this save point only appears after you return from the rooftops.



Temple of the Oracle
--------------------

Sequence break (swimming): just swim over the cutscene trigger at the yard of
the Temple of the Oracle. It is not necessary to watch.


Fight skip: you can skip the Harpy + Gorgons fight and the following scene by
jumping over the red barrier with a high jump.


Random: the water in the courtyard is not actually water.


"Temple of the Oracle" - save point


Easter egg: by activating three hidden R2-prompts in the yard of the Temple,
you get a message saying "Surrender Kratos" on the sky. A video probably
explains it the best...

Videos:
1, SirRaven's video
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXK7oyh8dE0


Random: Strange collision at the yard area

You may haven't noticed, but you can get on top of the pillar sections from
the right side of the yard where there is a chest. Do a high jump and you
grab a ledge. No use has been found for this area, but still...


Sequence break: skipping Harpies

The video clip of Harpies emerging inside the Temple of the Oracle can be
skipped with upgrading black-out time. While skipping the actual 14 seconds
long video, this also makes Harpies to never appear inside the temple in the
first place, possibly making any jump antics in the temple easier. But at the
same time, you lose the chance to farm Harpies for orbs, so it has its goods
and its bads.

You can complete the statue puzzle without any Harpies around. After putting
the statue in its place, it starts shaking (and you hear Harpy sounds) even
though there are no Harpies in existence in the vicinity!

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua5C3CTBREA


Sequence break (swimming): you can skip the Harpy intro scene by swimming
up as soon as possible when passing through the doorway. This way you barely
skip touching the trigger for it.


Various: Harpy glitches/tricks

Inside the temple Harpies will spawn infinitely. While one might think that
them stopping giving orbs is a glitch, it isn't. It is a mechanism implemented
by the game designers to prevent too much orb farming. But that shouldn't stop
a crafty gamer from farming orbs here...

If you put a statue in front of a hole, you can control the Harpies' spawning
rate/formation. You can f.e. get them all to spawn at once, which looks creepy
in being so symmetric. Note that if you start stone beaming them now you will
not get all the orbs you should: simultaneous shattered enemies do not yield
more orbs than just one or two shattered.

There's a very good way to get orbs in this place, and it is going to the
entrance stairway and waiting for the harpies to gather in front of you. Then,
shoot them to death with Medusa's Gaze very gently. Try to save your magic in
the process. The shatter death bonus is more than enough to get you large
amounts of orbs in no time, and this can be repeated as long as your magic
lasts. (~best success with regen magic enabled, of course)

Another way to get orbs here is by creating your very own Harpy orb fountain
using the statues here. But as far as infinite/large amounts of orbs go, the
above tip about shooting them with MG from the entrance is easier and faster
to do.

One harpy will always get "stuck" hovering over one of the fountains if you
hang around that area a bit.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid about an own harpy orb fountain:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=Pb6CrJYbV5A


Sequence break: skip Temple puzzle from downstairs

By doing Apollo's High Jump from on top of the fountain near the room's
entrance, you can reach the poles at the top and as such you can jump your
way to the room's exit even faster. (c: Satvara)

Some pointers regarding this jump:
- you need to start your jump from the very edge of the platform.
- use L1+X, Apollo's Ascension for this jump because of its better arc.
- Steer AA to the correct direction.
- instead of holding down R2 to do PR, do PR manually at the height of
  Apollo's Ascension. This way you squeeze in a little more reach than normal.
- the timing of your second jump is crucial.
- don't do Apollo's Offensive instantly after your second jump. Instead, wait
  a little to get some more reach from your jump, that's the only way to get
  far enough to hit the pole.
- it's a very precise jump, but it is possible to do it.

There is an easier variation to this jump too. You can repeat AO and PR a few
times to inch slightly closer to the poles before making the 2nd jump. (c:
Wulf2k9)

As a third variation, you can use LAM and AO to jump on top of the archway you
came in from and land on some angled floor. Using PR you can do Poseidon Jump
and from there jump to the poles above. (c: AKheon)

3, AKheon's vid of the LAM & Poseidon Jump variation:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACDfqY_yT4


Sequence break: Skip past the puzzle from upstairs

You can do a series of jumps at the top floor using the breaking poles and
reach the next area without pushing either of the statues. It is not easy
to do because of the chandelier collisions which usually block Kratos if he
jumps too high, but with correct timing you'll make it. (c: ballofsnow?)

You can also just use the normal pathway through this area quite easily, even
with the harpies around, if you got regen magic. Just jump and cast PR every
time you hear a harpy screech (indicating an attack). You're basically immune
to their attacks this way.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw4_079Bmak


"Path to the Oracle" - save point


Sequence break (swimming): you can skip past the Oracle cutscene by breaching
the ceiling. Before going out of the inner corridor, you'll notice the ceiling
has a small indention Kratos can swim into. So swim in it, then start swimming
diagonally up and to the back for about three or four strokes worth. Then do a
grab to have Kratos breach the ceiling and escape the corridor. (c: vipeazone?)

Videos:
1, AKheon's RTA where this trick is used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Ri0BOkthg#t=997


Collision flaw: Strange pushable pillar collision

Unlike with most other pushable objects, the two pillars inside the Oracle's
Temple's yard do not move away if Kratos jams himself between them and the wall.
This means that you can create your own cramped spaces that let you breach a
wall... in theory. But in practice only two of the railings can be breached
using the pillars for help. Also, after going out of bounds, navigation from
there to anywhere else is extremely difficult due to awful camera angles or
unstable floor collision, so there's really not much you can do with this.

2, Wulf2k9's extra out of bounds exploration:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKKao1O5WBk


Other: you can trigger the scene showing you the vines and talk to Oracle at
the same time. This causes the camera to slightly glitch up, but nothing else
in particular happens.


Wasted potential: it would've been interesting to see what would happen if
you activated the second part of Oracle rescuing (where the timer activates)
and then left this area. But that's probably not possible to do... not even
while swimming, because you have to be climbing the vines in order to start
the timer, and you can't do that while swimming.


Other: Oracle voice glitch

If you save Oracle before activating the second part minigame (in which the
countdown starts), you hear her shouts echoing in the area even after she's
safely on the ground.


Random: Why Oracle shouted so loudly?

Because the rope she was clinging on to was insubstantial, that's why. Try to
grab it with Kratos if you want to see for yourself.

Sequence break: Skipping saving Oracle altogether (c: satvara)

There is a very obscure wall breach that enables you to get past the locked
Oracle insignia door through the small pillars on the side of it. Apparently,
three well-placed Hermes Stomps is all it takes...

Some extra info. You see the formation of four pillars? Go near the lower-right
of them, and from there start doing HS diagonally towards the northern side of
the gate. Eventually you should be able to breach into the gate's north side.
Now, carefully walk further in to get closer to the door itself. Eventually
there's some collision that you simply can't walk past, so you have to do
another HS. At this point it's very easy to jump back out, so try to be careful.
You have to aim just slightly towards the door. You'll know you made it if you
see Kratos stand close to the door (close enough you see the R2-prompt) but
still out of bounds. From there just carefully jump around the door, and you're
set. Oh, and the Oracle? She'll be fine. Take my word for it.

Videos:
1, Satvara's video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=F3HOIBlo-lg


Sequence break: Skipping saving Oracle altogether - the slower version:

For 99% of people who can't do the above, there exists another sequence break
with which you can skip the timed section altogether. Get those two pillars on
top of each other, and get 'em almost directly under the spot the Oracle's
hanging from. Jump on top of the pillars and then do the highest possible normal
high jump, Apollo's High Jump. The game considers you having visited close
enough to Oracle for the game to continue with the cutscene of Kratos rescuing
Oracle... and that's it.

Videos:
1, Satvara's / Kewbev63's video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=IZjqAbT_W-Q


Other: the timer during the Oracle section keeps running even when time is
stopped (as in during the tutorial message you get right at the start of the
vines section). So, waiting long enough you can die in the tutorial message,
but it's unfortunately pretty pointless.


Random / wasted potential: the water surface in the middle of the yard and in
the small torch-lit pool is real. To the right of the small bridge it's not.
From testing, even if you could start swimming here, it doesn't seem like you
could go beneath water surface using the rocks or other collision nearby. I
even tried to use the pushable pillars as aid, but it didn't work.


"Suicide Bluffs" - save point


Speed trick (swimming): you can speed up reaching the sewer by first hitting
the Sewers loading trigger on the bridge, then backtracking and swimming to
the previous level transition while remaining out of bounds. It turns out that
most level transitions are "agnostic" regarding what is loaded, and therefore
Kratos gets sent to the Sewers even though you went to the wrong direction.
(c: AKheon)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5EVmQba6bk


Collision flaw: Holes in collision at this area

If you do Hermes Stomp to the uneven walls at the upper parts of the Bluffs
Kratos may drop through them to his death. I know at least 3 spots where this
happens.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6svnq6PDPDM#t=60


Trigger skip: Entrance to sewer stairs trigger skip

Sometimes the game will not transport Kratos to the next map (Sewers) as he
reaches the doorway. This causes him to run to a strange dead end, but he will
transport like normal again if you try to backtrack a bit. This will especially
happen if you approach the Sewer entrance too quickly.


Speed strat: After entering Sewers, you can high jump to the ledge above the
doorway and from there jump down to the sewers to skip going down the stairs.


Swimming glitch: you can do early swimming glitch here as well. Jump above
the doorway before descending down the stairs and carefully jump near the
bottom of the stairs. There's lots of water around, and you should be able
to hit it quite easily. Then swim inside bounds and try to swim up the stairs.
Kratos will suddenly disappear under the surface, and he is now free to dive
and control his movement without the fear of being shot into the skies (like
usually is with swimming glitch at this state).

You can go swimming in any of the earlier areas of the game and explore them
to your heart's content. You can also try to progress forward in the game, but
you'll finally get stuck at the Desert because there's the Siren fight there
that you can't beat while swimming.

2, findlestick's vid of taking swimming glitch into the Desert:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-d6I0a7i2I


Random: You can use high jump to reach the platforms near the ceilings you
can't normally reach. There is nothing there, but it still might be fun if you
want to explore hidden areas.


Collision flaw: When at the area with two Cyclops, do a high jump towards the
waterfall and grab its ledge. That area is somehow flawed, with Kratos starting
to flicker strangely. (well, such behavior is not too uncommon here, actually).


Strategy: By jumping onto the ladders of the area, your enemies will instantly
forget your presence.


Other: One of the Legionnaires is subject to being infinitely Orion's Harpooned,
like the one at Port of Athens. I have no further info on this matter, though.


Random: If you try to return to the Sewers after visiting the ground level,
there's an owl symbol blocking the path and you hear the Oracle say the same
line she says after you've rescued her and talk to her - basically the
instructions to Kratos on what to do next.


"Athens Battleground" - save point
note: effectively a different save point than the other Athens Battleground



Desert of Lost Souls
--------------------

Other: if you skip the initial cutscene at the Desert by swimming over it, the
Sirens do not appear in the level. This makes the intro scene of the Sirens look
rather strange since there is no one in it.

Also, if you skip the first cutscene, then approach it from the wrong side at
the same time you talk to the Athena statue... after the FMV you hear Athena
say the same thing multiple times at once instead of just once. A big whoop.

Your last checkpoint also glitches up: if you retry, the time is frozen (as if
you were still talking to Athena) and Kratos is absolutely stuck forever.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of the 2nd paragraph things:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2w3c9bhn2Y#t=144


Strategy: Defeating first Siren easily

Sirens are very vulnerable to stoning, dying after 3 times. In fact, the first
Siren can be destroyed during her introduction cutscene by just petrifying her
repeatedly. Easy!

Wulf2k9 also has this to say: "The AI of the first desert siren will break
after restarting from checkpoint, if she's evading when it saves. She'll respond
to direct attacks, but will never wander and can be plumed to death."

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's video of the petrification tactic
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlv45MvGDKc


Random: If you go far enough from a Siren and wait a bit, it goes back to its
'wandering' mode, singing and moving aimlessly.


Random: The three Sirens you're supposed to defeat have 10000HP, which is a lot.
But you only need to trickle about 125HP away to activate the minigame which
kills them automatically, and that's what most people instinctively do in their
games. If you do away all of their 10000HP they die like normal, and the gate
gets one more soul in it like it should.


Sequence break: Skipping all Sirens + puzzle

Find the entrance to the Temple area. Go to the left for a bit, so that the
structure ends and you face a wall of sand. With a well-placed Hermes Rush
you clip right through the wall/floor and drop into the temple. Very
convenient! (c: satvara)

As a bonus you can also skip opening the next door if you take care to fall
on the conveyor belt below while still out of bounds. There's a thin stretch
of land that you must traverse on (perfectly angled rolls work) until you reach
the area below the door. From there, just high jump up to get behind the door
without opening it, saving a few seconds more.

"Desert of Lost Souls" - save point


Sequence break: Skipping the conveyor belt with a high jump

You can high jump your way to the next area very easily without needing the box
for extra height. The height is so low that a PR-less high jump is enough. (c:
GMG)


Sequence break: Skipping blowing the first horn

Do an Apollo's High Jump on top of one of the upper pedestals. Then jump around
the sandstorm to the other side!

It's the easiest to do this if you have PR, but it's just barely possible to do
the jump with Gorgon Flash as well. First ascension, air square attack, double
jump, Gorgon Flash and AO in a quick succession.

Videos:
1, Satvara's video:
         https://youtube.com/watch?v=MB5o9dfzRMg


Wasted potential: the mandatory Siren fight before blowing the second horn makes
it currently impossible to get to Pandora's Temple with swimming glitch on.

So... how to get rid of a bunch of Sirens while swimming...? Unloading the map
doesn't seem to help in this case.



Temple of Pandora
-----------------

"Pandora's Bridge" - save point


Scene skip: there's a small scene showing you the area as you approach the yard,
but you can jump over it using a high jump. This is the easiest to do with a
PR high jump, but you can also do the jump by setting up LAM and using AO.

You can also do this skip with black-out glitch since there is a checkpoint
shortly before the cutscene trigger.

Fun fact: if you now visit the corpse guy and then activate this scene, you
sometimes see two corpse guys at the same time at the corpse pile!

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of the second method
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNig_1pVb8


Sequence break: By utilizing Hermes Rush, you can wedge Kratos through a wall
behind the health chest left of the large gate. This allows you to skip some
cutscenes and a fight, so it's a fast, useful trick to know. (c: Satvara)

There's also an alternative, slower way that doesn't require you to have
upgraded Blades at all. Do an ascension on top of the chest facing right and
hold block as you fall down. This way Kratos ends up behind the chest. Then,
after landing quickly aim Medusa's Gaze behind you, and you should pop through
the wall and get inside the corridor early. (c: Wulf2k9)

2, Wulf2k9's video of the latter method:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=E1xYN0A0K0E


Other: Oddities in moving corpse's behaviour

First of all: if you access his platform from the wrong direction, the cutscene
where Kratos and him talk will not load and he just continues doing whatever he
was doing normally. During this time his collision is such you can jump on him
and let him move you around.

Secondly: I don't know how it happens, probably after unexpected routes Kratos
can take during this level. The corpse person completely disappears from the
level and you can't proceed. This can also happen with discs with loading
problems.


Other: Cutscene black-out glitch

As you approach the corpse person the correct route, once you get close enough,
the screen blackens. If you now hastily move away from the platform you're on,
the cutscene will never start and you keep the black screen eternally.
Basically, it makes progress pretty much impossible... and it carries over a
save too, so you can ruin your file by doing this.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=gtUlfeU990o


Random: Strange thing with the scenery harpy

You know the harpy that is bringing some corpses to burn at the bonfire? You
can jump on top of it with a high jump and let it carry Kratos off to distant
lands. Well, not-so-distant anyhow. The journey cuts short when the harpy
unloads and Kratos falls down into a chasm.


Random: when a corpse is dropped in the fire, other graphical effects (such as
Kratos' blades during an air Cyclone of Chaos) may behave erratically.


Sweet spot: during the fight against the two Cyclops, you can stay relatively
safe by hugging close to the left side of the gate front. From there it's easy
to blast away at the foes with Medusa's Gaze and then shatter them with
Poseidon's Rage (hope you have regen magic, though).

Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__NGiSRfAqc


Sequence break: skip Pandora's Temple's gate and lobby

You can jump over the gate that you'd have to rotate the crank to open. Pretty
simple, and doesn't save much time in the end.

However, from on top of the gate you can follow things up with another skip,
and that is that you can jump straight inside the rings from here, skipping
the Entrance and its battle and scenes altogether. You can also jump directly
to the Inner Rings using this route by using the collision of the statues that
you find inside the large hall. (credits: satvara)

Get to the left side of the gate, then do one Apollo's Ascension to get over a
not too high wall in the way. Now you should be outside bounds and roughly as
far as left and to the back of the gate as possible. Then, do a long jump
forward - it helps if you use "lenient air momentum" and Apollo's Offensive two
times before jumping straight forward. If you see Kratos slip inside the lobby
at any point, then you were not left enough. Try to stay out of bounds.

Anyway, Kratos will grab a ledge of the invisible platform - actually one of the
statues inside the lobby. Climb on top of it. From there, you can walk about 2,5
steps forward before the platform ends, so be careful. Stay within the limits of
the platform and do a small ALJ ahead of you to land on another invisible
platform. This platform is slightly smaller than the first one, and the jump to
the third platform ahead is more difficult. Satvara's original tactic
intentionally jumps down to hang on from a ledge of the 2nd platform to be able
to do an easier long jump, but lenient air momentum is again an option.

From there on there looks to be more floor. Another long jump is required at the
end in order to get Kratos land inside the Inner instead of the Outer Ring...
perhaps better instructions will follow one day. ยง

Rings of Pandora
----------------

"Temple of the Crystal Eye" - save point
note: hereafter this location is abbreviated as TotE


Other: early swimming glitch at the Rings (c: satvara)

You can use Gliding to slide up the large dome-like formation at the center
of the Rings. It doesn't have a ceiling, so you'll eventually fall inside the
innermost ring. If you use LAM while sandwiched between water and the ceiling,
Kratos drops down near the crank. Jumping back up to the water surface pushes
Kratos down and activates free dive mode even without the Trident, thus
starting swimming glitch.

You can do this as early as when you first arrive at Pandora's Temple if you
used the other tricks above (getting to inner rings early).

Wasted potential: infiltrating Challenge of Poseidon from wrong direction

With early swimming glitch, you can reach the final area of Challenge of
Poseidon early. The elevator that rises up to the Challenge is somewhat
glitchy, so with careful timing you can exit it early and clip out of bounds.
Unfortunately you can't reach the rest of the challenge - and the Trident -
early from here, since the loading triggers do not allow it. Nothing is loaded
past the large gate with Poseidon's picture on it.

Sequence break: Skipping 90% of Challenge of Atlas

Satvara outwitted this section of the game. It's possible to get to the end
corridor of Challenge of Atlas from the Temple of the Eye and fetch the skull
from there, skipping most of the Challenge.

First you need to do a high jump against the edge of the moving crusher. Hope
you hadn't turned those things off yet... There's a ledge on the side of the
crusher, so get Kratos to grab it. Keep moving to the left while hanging onto it
to have the wall suck Kratos in. This doesn't have a 100% success chance. I
think the most important thing that determines your success is your position on
the ledge, and also that you keep moving to the left while hanging. Sometimes it
may help to push to left in fast intermittent spurts rather than all the time.
It also doesn't hurt to adjust your timing so that you grab the crusher's ledge
rather early, before it starts to retract.

Now you're out of bounds for a short moment. Do a droopy double jump towards the
camera and to the left, enough to land on the pool's floor, but still remaining
out of bounds. Then you have to blindly move to get closer to the CoA corridor
without ending up inside the pool or falling off the map.

The corridor itself seems too high to reach with just a basic high jump, but if
you aim for the spot beneath the CoA door, the floor is low enough there that
you can hit it and gain some extra jumps for pulling through. Remember to finish
this high jump with Apollo's Offensive for that precious extra height.

Then move through the hallway to get to the ladder there. Now another high jump
is needed because the top of the ladder is blocked off (you never moved the
coffin off the ladder, remember?). Again, using Apollo's Offensive with a good
enough air momentum, you actually pass through the coffin and can finish the
level in record time.

However: in a Real-Time Attack this strategy might not be the fastest after
all. This is because of the 2 minutes long pre-rendered cutscene inside the
CoA exit corridor that you can skip using another tactic instead. Not to
mention you probably cannot do this skip at all without PR...

Videos:

        http://youtube.com/watch?v=gvAPfEaTchg
2, AKheon's tutorial of the trick:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ixPEb9CdvI


Other: if you do the above skip, some enemies will spawn into the TotE corridor
even though the crushers are still working. They can get hit by the crushers,
although it looks like they don't get much damage from them in comparison to
Kratos.

Having crushers active yields especially interesting results after CoP, since
you get Magic Legionnaires instead. They get hit by the crushers despite their
shield, and sometimes go into a strange looking reaction animation - during
which they can be grabbed and thrown.


Fight "skip": Legionnaire fights in TotE

After completing CoA or CoP, you'll have to fight some Legionnaires when trying
to leave TotE. However, if you save at TotE and quickly roll out of there during
the black-out time, you skip having to fight them.

However, the thing with the Legionnaire fight is that they are never really
skipped: they are only postponed. The next time you return to the area, the
fight trigger is still there. Eventually many fight triggers overlap and the
enemies from all the fights spawn at once. Well, I suppose it's more time
efficient to fight all the enemies at once rather than fight small separate
groups, so in that way this can save time...

This particular way of skipping the fight trigger relies on saving and loading
the game, so it's not useful outside a segmented run. Depending on your route,
though, the Legionnaire fight can become postponed otherwise too.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gTcPTrw8FI#t=66


Other: I've heard of a glitch where the fight boundaries will not disappear
even after all Magic Legionnaires have been killed when fighting them in the
TotE corridor. The game does not register final kill? Or could this be related
to combining Legionnaire fights? In any case, rare.


Wasted potential: after having pulled the switch to stop the crushers, you can
bypass the cutscene that starts as you exit by using black-out time. However,
it's useless as you need the cutscene to open up the handles for the Eye device.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iemyDTrfWc#t=111


Collision flaw: The crusher traps inside TotE can hit Kratos even after they're
disabled in some circumstances. Especially if you Hermes Rush towards them.


Other: Access unloaded outer areas

By completing Challenge of Poseidon before Challenge of Atlas, the small door
that would close when you leave the unaligned Temple of the Eye will not close.
Now you have three entrances from the outermost ring: to the inner ring, to TotE
or Challenge of Atlas.

If you change areas and return to the TotE entrance, its innards are mostly
unloaded. You can activate the eye machine or start swimming glitch by tring to
leave through the half-unloaded pool. If you turn the wheel you can also get
Challenge of Atlas to appear unloaded, though this isn't useful.

- Satvara has reported that whenever entering or exiting the glitched TotE,
  the formation of the rings resets.
- Unfortunately it seems that the beam of light you can send from TotE must
  physically touch the crystal at the other end for something to happen (e.g.
  any closed doorways are counted for).
- Satvara also found a way to the unloaded TotE in normal game conditions.
  There used to be a video of it, but not any more. From what I recall, the
  trick involved walking on the wall of the inner ring and doing a long jump
  from on top of there over the outer ring wall to land inside the unloaded
  TotE.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of swimming through CoA that uses this trick:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=q9N0MkCQh14


Collision flaw: Getting to Challenge of Hades early

You can reach Challenge of Hades' water tunnel pretty easily by doing a few
jumps from the higher area leading to Challenge of Poseidon. First, jump on top
of the inner wall. You can stand on top of it and walk around the Rings like
this, to an extent. In a certain spot very close by, you'll find some shoddy
collision in the floor and you'll fall through. This is your chance to move
inside the underwater passage.

Unfortunately you can't pass Challenge of Hades without the Poseidon's Trident,
so as of yet doing this isn't too useful.

Sequence break: rolling stone skip

You can reach the ladder without having to go all around the Rings by doing a
simple high jump from the ground level.

Alternatively, you can land on the rolling stone itself by doing a BoA ascension
when it's pretty close. Continuing with the BoA air combo should let Kratos land
on the stone quite comfily and go on from there.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTPOlHax8pI


Sequence break: rolling stone cutscene skip

When climbing up the ladder leading to Challenge of Poseidon, there's a cutscene
in which the ladder descends and the rolling stone disappears somewhere
underneath the Temple. However, you can avoid activating this cutscene with a
BoA Flash jump off and back on the ladder. This saves over 20 seconds, but as
a side effect, the rolling stone will stay active inside the temple for the
rest of the game. This can cause trouble in a speedrun if the runner has bad
luck. (c: ThaRixer)

Random: after the ladder cinematic Kratos' position is moved forcefully, even
if you were not on or even near the ladder.



Challenge of Atlas
------------------

Sequence break: Skipping Blade of Artemis

By doing a Hermes Rush to the right-hand wall of the BoA corridor and pressing
L1 the instant Kratos seems to 'rise' up the wall, you start gliding. With this
movement you go right past BoA without getting it. (c: AKheon)

"Challenge of Atlas" - save point


Sequence break: skipping Shields and the saw room in CoA (c: satvara)

With strategic high jumps and loading trigger manipulating you can pass through
this challenge without doing any of the puzzles.

To skip directly past the shield door, first go to the corridor leading up to
it with Gorgons in it to load the next area. Then, backtrack to the stairs
leading up in the main area, go a bit to the left to get a better camera angle
for yourself and then do a BoA high jump from on top of the chest. Not too
high, just enough to get over the wall and drop down on floor while out of
bounds.

From here you can either jump into the saw room, which is forward and pretty
close by... pretty simple. Or you can remain out of bounds and do a series of
jumps leading you directly past the closed door you'd normally have to open
using the two switches amidst the moving saws. Nowadays this is not too hard
since we have BoA Flash jumps. Align Kratos in a certain way so that he is a
little to the left of the chest you see in the distance and jump forward. Just
don't start the jump from too far to the right or there is some invisible wall
in front of you. Not to mention you'll slip right inside the saw room if you
go too much to the right.

One third method of skipping the Shields can be done without any upgrades.
From near where the Shield of Zeus is, if you do a double jump towards the
wall above the shield door, there's some shoddy collision and you can fall
through into the saw room. (c: AKheon)

3, satvara's original video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=CG9A08eMdMU


Strategy: you can do A.I. glitches with the ladder that is deeper inside the
area with the Shield of Zeus. Climb on the ladder, wait for your enemy to climb
after you. Then jump off: they get stuck.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IDg1l3pJes#t=104


Sequence break: you can high jump up to Shield of Zeus from in front of the
rotating wall. Aim so that you can grab a ledge at the end of the jump and
climb to the 2nd floor, and that's it, you're there. (c: GMG)

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIHOf6OAQc#t=41


Random: Shield of Zeus' and Hades' prompts are pretty unique somehow. If you
glitch the 'Yes' / 'No' selector by going to a menu and then pick a glitched
third option, Kratos doesn't freeze - instead game continues as if you had said
'No'.


A.I. Flaw: If you get stonefrozen in front of the shield door and examine it
once, all enemies in the area forget your presence and you are not in danger
of being shattered after that.


Sequence break: You can get to Hades' Shield extremely quickly by doing a long
jump when descending on the rope. (c: satvara)

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIHOf6OAQc#t=34


Sequence break: you can skip the rope section that leads to Hades' Shield with
a BoA high / long jump as well. You can use the pillars in the forefront as
floor to land on, speeding up the jumping process. But this is still not as
fast as just doing a long jump from the rope.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBdQMRlYdlk


Other: you can examine Shield of Hades and roll backwards to get out of the
corridor of doom before it encloses and you're in danger of becoming smushed.
What follows is that the crusher slowly makes its way to the other end of the
corridor and then you become checkpointed. You can either return to the upper
level the way you came or high jump on top of the crusher and make your way
to the normal exit of the area to see all the legionnaires stuck in a cramped
space between the crusher and the red barrier that never dissipated. Pretty
humorous!

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bz0cq-c_o#t=65


Other: the Gorgons can rarely follow you past the shield door, only to become
unloaded in a moment's time. You could probably use this unloading limit for
infinite red orbs, although the glitch can be difficult to perform with Gorgons.


"The Path to Atlas" - save point


Random: Kratos can 'ride' on saws for extremely quick movement... probably
not controllable.


Other: THE famous spot for infinite orbs

Yes, you've seen it a million times already, the most popular spot for garnering
a full set of orbs: the ladder at Challenge of Atlas. If you get a Harpy stuck
on top of the ladder to the far-right as it dies, it will die endlessly and
emits an endless amount of red orbs in the process.

1, Joker060606's video of the Challenge of Atlas infinite orbs fountain:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=hRxl9yffSdc


Strategy: in the collapsing floor fight, you don't actually even have to fight
any enemies to win. Just make sure to start a BoA long jump right before the
floor collapses beneath you. As the enemies fall down to their deaths, the red
barrier in front of the switch dissipates and then you can reach it. Could be
worth a try if you're desperate.


"The Cliffs of Atlas" - save point
note: this one spawns only after you've got the Atlas Handle.


Speed strat: you can save a little bit of time while on the ledge leading to
the Atlas statue room by jumping the rest of the way after passing the middle.


Sequence break: leave the Atlas room early

Eventually you get into the room where there's the large Atlas statue. You can
quickly get to the upper level by going near the exit door and doing a regular
PR high jump against it - Kratos can grab a ledge above it. From there, double
jump to get to the balcony to the left of you. Then, you can do another high
jump to get over the walls and just get the heck out of this place.

For the second jump, you can do it with just Blades as well. AHJ that ends with
Hermes Stomp should do it.

Videos:
1, satvara's original vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG9A08eMdMU#t=52


Strategy: There are three different places in the room with the Atlas statue
where you can trick enemies' attacks by examining R2-prompts at a correct time.
The prompts are the handle-less crank, the Atlas statue and the large door that
is broken later. Useful for combat, as enemies' attacks will pass right through
you when you examine any prompts (credits to GMG for the original write-up).


Other: Atlas switch glitch

If you activate the Atlas rock pusher mechanism switch twice in a row quickly,
the switch will eternally get stuck to the 'on' position, and you can't use it
again. You have to reload your save or skip the entire room to proceed.


Other: Graphical glitch while picking up the Architect's Son's skull

If you stand at the edge of the coffin and not on top of it, Kratos will grab
at nothingness and tear away a piece of nothingness to use as a skull.

Sequence break: backwards CoA

Instead of entering the newly opened pathway that leads you underground, you
can backtrack through CoA again and leave it that way instead. This lets you
skip a 2 minutes long pre-rendered cutscene and other smaller things in the
process, so for fastest possible times it is recommended to do this in a RTA,
even though it makes the route through this part more complicated.

To get back into the Atlas room... well, that's easy. Jump on top of the chest
near the large door and from there do a low high jump to land on some floor
above the door. From on top of that just a double jump is enough to get back
inside the Atlas room.

The biggest problem is getting into the shield room since you never opened the
shield door in the first place in a speedrun. If you have PR, you have the
option to do a very big high jump over the wall of the saw room and land out of
bounds to the left. If you were careful not to fall to your death, you are now
back in the first room of the Challenge while still out of bounds, ready to
bypass the gate in front of the exit by just running and jumping around it.

Without PR doing such a high jump is not a possibility. Therefore, you need to
clip into the shield room through the floor. The most reliable known way of
doing that is this: from the save point below the shield room, backtrack closer
towards the shield door. Find the fourth wooden block at ceiling level, the one
closest to the corner. Your objective is to get on top of it, so do a BoA
Flash jump. My jump setup involves going close to the right back corner of
the hallway and from there picking up a small running momentum, then doing the
BoA Flash Jump against back wall and left. Almost as if aiming to the corner of
the ceiling block. However, once you're close to rising on top of it, turn more
left instead. Kratos should land on a specific spot on the block - one that
will now push him away if he doesn't act quick. Do a jump, Medusa's Gaze and
fuse glitch into Apollo's Offensive, and Kratos should clip through.

It's all just a matter of finding the correct spot in the ceiling that Kratos
is able to breach through, and landing on the ceiling block in the right way
almost guarantees that Kratos is at the correct spot. This is reliable enough
to do in a RTA, and even if you fail it the first time, the save nearby insures
that you don't have to retry from very far away.

To get past the gate blocking the entrance, jump out of bounds by using the
same collision flaw you used earlier to skip the saw room for instance. Or go
to the 2nd floor and jump from there... there are a few different options.
Fastest is probably jumping right over the gate, but this is a bit tricky since
you have to get Kratos sink into the ceiling collision a bit, which can be
inconsistent.

Challenge of Poseidon
---------------------

"Poseidon's Challenge" - save point


Sequence break: skip the Cerberi fight

It's recommended to use black-out time to skip the trigger to avoid both the
Cerberi fight intro cutscene as well as having to jump over the fight barrier
afterwards. But you need to set this up beforehand by having upgraded Blades
to almost full level. (c: AKheon)

In case that's not possible, there is a more difficult version of the
black-out glitch that allows you to skip the fight without upgrading the
Blades, if you roll through the fight trigger while retrying in a very
precise way. (c: Python77)

However, if you don't do that, just jumping over the fight barrier
will also do. BoA high jumps work the best for this.

2, Python77's vid of the alternative black-out skip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGdSm_aOkvc


Sequence break: You avoid the fight with Cyclops and moving the big block
around by just running past everyone. Slightly suicidal on higher difficulties.


Sequence break: You can skip the fight before the turning room by doing a BoA
high jump over the red wall. You need to squeeze Kratos right between the wall
and the ceiling, but it can be done with correct timing.

Or, you could just do Hermes Rush towards the red barrier. There's a very small
collision flaw in it that allows Kratos to slip through. This seems harder
to do in the HD version, though. (c: satvara)

Videos:
1, Satvara's vid of the faster way:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=zFxg3QJdm0w


Sequence break: with Dairy Bastard, you can do a huge infinite jump while the
rotating room is still rotating to escape it early. While the jump you have to
do is big, this still saves 15-20 seconds. But as a drawback, you skip the red
orb chests in the process.


Save point - Sacrifice of Poseidon
note: this is a NTSC-only save point. Why? No idea...


Sequence break: in the NTSC-version, you can use the nearby save point and
create black-out time to get past the cage showing cutscene.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's video
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djxM7zJqu_4


Sequence break: Quickly getting the cage down

The cage inside of which is the object of sacrificial (a human in some versions,
an undead Legionnaire in others) is possible to lower by two ways: one is by
turning the crank, one is by jumping right next to it to an invisible platform
up high and pushing it to the ground. Just an odd/clever piece of level design.
But jumping up to it also skips the FMV that follows having lowered the cage,
so doing that is recommended. (c: GMG?)

If you want to make this jump a little less slippery, feel free to jump all the
way up past the cage until you reach some floor high above. From there you can
drop behind the cage in a controlled way, without as much fear of missing your
goal and wasting time.

Videos:
1, Kevbew63's demonstration:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=wTmnsDH87yw


Other: the sound of the caged Legionnaire can be a lot louder than other SFX.


Sequence break: the sacrifice sequence in its whole can be skipped by doing an
arduous BoA jump. First over the wall at the last room's south side, then just
long jumping (with assumedly BoA) outside walls to the other side of the sealed
door. Regen/infinite magic is needed. (c: satvara)

This skip is far more difficult to do without PR. Therefore, in a run that
skip PR you might want to do the sacrifice sequence normally (with speed strats)
instead.

"Poseidon's Chamber" - save point


Other: reverse CoP playthrough (c: AKheon / satvara)

Entering the Chamber, if you do a high jump at a correct time you get over the
trigger that closes the door behind you, allowing you to fetch the Trident and
then return back the way you came. This route is not faster than just doing
the rest of the Challenge normally, but it's something interesting to consider.

The biggest problem of this route is the rotating room, which takes ages to run
its course. Also, if you had skipped any fights at the beginning of the
challenge, now you have to skip them again!

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDt2jhzDAVc


Random: You can climb ladders from "the wrong direction", behind them, in
Poseidon's Chamber.


Sequence break: You can skip unfolding the stairway of Poseidon's Chamber by
doing a high enough BoA high jump. Viable with regen magic and no upgrades.
This becomes even faster if you use fuse glitch to do a normal jump as the
last thing: there's a ledge you can grab.

Perhaps in tool-assisted conditions the may be another option for skipping it:
doing a super jump out of the water. You get really high and far, but it's too
difficult to control in real time.


Speed strat / wasted potential: You will skip the swimming tutorial if you don't
jump into the water pools of Poseidon's Chamber. But obviously, you have no
choice in the matter unless you plan on escaping the Chamber with a high jump.


Other: here's a glitch that might be unique to the Vita-version of God of War.
Enter the small area from Poseidon's Chamber where you pull a switch and fight
some small Cerberi. Doing Might of Hercules repeatedly here causes the water
surface to go crazy! This might work in other places with water on ground too.

Videos:
1, Ransom Garcia's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT5vOapdksk


Sequence break: Skipping things with swimming glitch

You can swim out through the walls in at least two different places in the
upcoming underwater section. The fastest currently known method is at the Nyad
you see floating in the middle of the room. There's a well-lit ceiling window
right above her. You have to move against the window or dash so that Kratos
slightly clips inside the wall. You'll see him enter the ceiling next to the
window, but he still can't escape. Then, move to the front of the window
carefully and dash upwards. Kratos may escape doing this. (c: satvara)

The original, easier method of leaving the underwater hallway is before the
first insta-death trap. Wiggle against the ceiling right in front of the
entrance, and eventually you should pass through. (c: (among alleged
others) Euqununique)

You can swim from here to the end of the Challenge. Going any further is not
possible because of a teleportation trigger between maps - Kratos is forcibly
taken back in-bounds before reaching TotE. If you skip the last room of the
Challenge, as a bonus you also skip the fight after reaching TotE, so doing
that is the fastest outcome.

Videos:

2, Satvara's speedrun demonstration of the old method:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=9E2qMv10kEk


Other: You can activate "reverse swimming glitch" in the corridor which is
not completely submerged right before the spiked corridor. Try dashing to the
roof at different places and it might happen. It's not useful, though, but
just to mention it. I first saw this in a Youtube-video that I can't seem to
find nowadays any more.


Other: Insta-death trap glitch

The corridor with the whirling array of all sorts of blades and spikes will
not always kill Kratos instantly when it closes shut. He might get stuck in
there for a longer time, losing his life little by little. You get to see the
buzzsaw animation right to the end, and it is not a pretty sight - it goes
nowhere, the saws just freeze strangely and look messed up.

"Flooded Passage" - save point


Speed strategy: Moving metal slab/grating corridor glitch

You know the part where there's a long sideways corridor and these strange
slabs of metal that run through it periodically? You're supposed to go to left,
but going to right is actually more useful. This is because you get two of the
slabs appear at the same time, causing the trap to lose its lethality and turn
into a fast method of transportation. The glitched doubleslab will drop Kratos
off at the left end of the corridor, right next to the exit. Very convenient.
But note that this glitch will only happen if your position is as low as
possible when you're moving to the right. (c: AKheon)

"Amphitrite's Temple" - save point


Collision flaw: Passing elevator's ceiling

The underwater elevator at the end of CoP will suck Kratos in through the
ceiling if you're close enough or swim upwards. It looks a bit strange but
does nothing harmful. However, if you do the same thing downwards, you CAN
actually get outside boundaries.. (not useful on this occasion, though)


Out of bounds: rarely you can go out of bounds from the corridor that leads you
back to the Temple of the Eye if you swim aiming downwards around the place.
If this could be done reliably, it might lead to some useful strategies...


Other: An event glitch when returning to Challenge of Poseidon

The elevator you used at the end of the Challenge works the other way around
too, so you can return to CoP afterwards. But after you swim out of the elevator
at its upper end and then try to re-enter it, it disappears to thin air and you
have to go pull the nearby switch to get it up and working again.



Challenge of Hades
------------------

Sequence break: You can skip the short in-game cutscene showing the large hall
by doing a small jump at the correct spot. Try this: step onto the omega symbol
and from it do a relaxed double jump, Apollo's Offensive, air square attack and
then Hermes Stomp. By just doing a small "long jump" like this you go over the
intro cutscene trigger and save some time. (c: satvara)

Wasted potential: it's not possible to simply go past the big door and go fetch
the next skull: nothing is loaded beyond the doorway until you've beaten
Pandora's Guardian. Also, while you can reach the boss wheel early, it can't be
activated until you've hit the respective triggers in CoH upstairs. So for now
there is no way to skip fighting this boss.


"The Hall of Hades" - save point


Sequence break: Do a high jump to the balcony where there's the button for
bringing up Hades Statue. You can grab its ledge, easy deal. (c: satvara)

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIHOf6OAQc#t=60


Wasted potential: you can get to the bottom of the blood pool without swimming
by using the water surface breaching trick. On PS3, Kratos is able to pull the
switch that's there even like that, although he gets stuck afterwards, rendering
this trick pretty useless. On PS2, the switch pulling animation doesn't even
get a chance to begin as it interrupts instantly, so it won't work there either.


Strategy: For the (nowadays) optional Centaur sacrifice, a great sweet spot is
right in the blood pool. Your enemies will ignore you if you jump in. Coming
from the pool, you can also hang out at the edges of the pool without the
enemies being able to notice you.


Sequence break: If you nonetheless wish to pass by the lower regions, you can
use this hole in the wall to skip the 'kill all enemies'-segment.

This may very well be the oldest known sequence break for this game. It was
already used in speedruns back in 2006. I believe the trick was originally found
by an unknown person at GameFAQs boards.

Speed strat: if you roll backwards and then Dash so that Kratos ends up on the
upstairs button, you can activate the Hall upstairs intro cutscene and Hades
statue cutscenes at the same time. This causes the latter to end early, giving
Kratos free movement some seconds earlier than usual. However, it also takes
a few seconds to set up, so it might not be worth it after all in a run.

Another effect doing this has is that you create a delayed checkpoint. But
that's hardly useful for anything else than creating softlocks!

Speed strat: if you're extremely precise, you may try to roll off the button
at the same time the Hades statue becomes active. It causes the next cutscene's
camera to glitch (it shows Kratos instead of the statue) and you also get a
head start to your next destination.


Speed strat: You can use the floor pool to do a water high jump (a.k.a XXL jump,
uber jump, etc.) up to the statue. (c: satvara)

"The Chamber of Hades" - save point
note: only spawns after having activated Hades statue's light


Other: If you have both the Centaur fight and Hades statue activated at the
same time (possible with sequence breaks), the game starts lagging moderately
and some camera angles are screwed up because of the statue. Don't want to
think about what would happen with music glitch on top of the whole thing...


Swimming glitch: if you want to utilize swimming glitch in Challenge of Hades,
reach the water pool inside the maze and touch it from out of bounds. That
seems to be the only way to get swimming glitch in this area.

Sequence break: skip everything until Blades of Hades (c: satvara)

So, the corridor with the balls of fire is open before you. Doing a few
strategic high jumps, you can skip everything from here until Blades of Hades!

You have to move in the corridor past the 2nd door to hit a loading trigger.
I recommend a movement tactic of rollrush that is turned into timed quick
rolls whenever you need to abuse i-frames to go past the damaging balls. When
the last ball rolls through Kratos you may even use weapon switch i-frames for
extra speed and style points.

After that, turn to the left and BoA high jump over the wall. Using LAM is too
much of a hassle with the fiery balls running past all the time, so you should
start the jump with a basic Ascension. Use fuse glitch to do your double jump
in the middle of the high jump to save time and ensure you don't run out of
magic during the jump (which may very well happen with a classic BoA jump).

There are a few meters of floor out of bounds floor adjacent to the corridor,
so don't fall off it. Now you're supposed to go back to the direction where you
came from, although there is a dead end room in the way. You have to go around
it using either an Apollo's long jump or a BoA long jump. Don't get too close to
the dead end room at any point or you may accidentally slip inside it, or even
in a less severe case ruin your camera angle. For an easier time, use a BoA
long jump.

Continue to the direction the corridor started from until you get close to the
first dead end room. Now you should do a BoA long jump to the left. If you
start the jump from too close to the 2nd dead end room, you get a bad camera
angle, but this is not too hard to avoid. Use your usual BoA long jumping
tactics like substituting a PR here and there with a Gorgon Flash, and also
remember the existence of the fuse glitch. If you haven't upgraded MG, a classic
BoA jump also suffices, but it's a bit slower to do. You should land in the
circular room and from there can continue on your way to Blades of Hades.

Since you came to the circular room from a strange direction, you also skipped
a trigger that would start a fight here, so that saves some extra time as well.

However, if you happen to have full Rage, you can use a very fast rope crossing
trick that is at least nearly as fast as doing this with less trouble. Read more
below.

2, AKheon's demo of the trick using newer tactics:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkPBVRbKY2k


Sequence break: Rope crossing tricks

There is this large chasm with a rope running over it. In the background there
are several Archers which kill Kratos in just one arrow by plummeting him into
the lava below if he tries to cross the rope before dealing with them. Getting
across without having to bother with the Archers constitutes as a quick rope
crossing.

A trick Satvara found for doing this was to activate RotG while crossing. This
makes the arrows largely harmless to Kratos, increasing your chance of success
thousandfoldly. However, RotG doesn't last long enough for a completely safe
passage, making this a fast, yet still somewhat risky method.

While on rope, it is not possible to use, say, magics. However, it is possible
for Kratos to drop down from the rope, do a magic, and then grab the rope again
with the usage of L1+X. This allows to attack enemies with more efficiency while
on the rope and you will get further on before RotG runs out. The trick itself
is slightly tricky, especially if used with Gorgon Flash with its wonky aiming,
and as such it is still risky. (c: AKheon)

Satvara later devised a few safer methods of getting past this part. All involve
BoA long jumping. First is a legit skip in itself that skips the rope crossing
entirely, although it's not super fast. First you have to skip the Minotaurs by
high jumping over the red barrier on the way to the Archers. Then another high
jump is needed to go out of bounds at the left end of the Archer platform.
Finally, once out of bounds, you can reach the circular room with a BoA long
jump. The best thing with this approach is that it's practically risk-free.

A faster variation is doing a BoA jump from the rope platform, but inching away
from archers enough as to completely make their platform become unloaded. Kratos
can move forward quite a bit without the risk of arrows. At the middle way
Kratos should get back to the rope and deal the rest of it using RotG.

"Blades of Hades" - save point


Random: Amusing oneself with heights

As you know, during CoH when you're at the upper parts of the chamber, Kratos
will emit a shout when he passes a certain point when falling down. If you're
swimming in air, you can safely reach the trigger where he switches animation
and starts shouting. Basically, he starts flailing his arms and legs and
screams, nothing happens. Then he does it again, and again and again...

NOTE: during my first playthrough I thought Kratos was so tough a guy he never
ever screams, not even as he dies. Well, this place is an exception...

Other: apparently there is a glitch which turns the background SFX off or
to a very low volume in the Blades of Hades level. According to R Blackout:

"You simply go into another game file, then return to the menu, go back into
the Blades of Hades file, go back to the ares where you had to fight all the
enemies, make sure the music volume is off and the sound FX volume is on, then
press the "select" button on your remote and choose "restart from last
checkpoint". It should return you to the Blades of Hades save point. From
there, continue to go through the Blades of Hades. You will notice that the
background sound FX either goes off completely or goes so low that you can even
hear the wood crunching sound FX of the cylinders spinning the blades around. I
like the mechanism sound FX (the one that sounds like chains being bashed
together). This glitch allows me to turn up the volume from the usual 12 to 24
without giving the Subwoofer a bass overload due to the amount of bass in
the background sound FX.

Sequence break: Skip most of CoH's upper level by doing a high jump under the
rope used to slide to the balcony where there's the Boss Wheel. (c: AKheon)

Videos:
1, Kewbew's handy demonstration:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=3FOI6c5hkcQ


Trigger skip: saving at the The Hall of Hades-save, then loading game from the
main menu and rolling quickly, you can bypass the trigger at the boss room
doorway during black-out time.

As a result of having skipped the trigger, the room exits never close down,
allowing you to escape before the boss fight starts. If you leave back to the
Rings of Pandora and return, the boss fight triggers have all unloaded, and
you're stuck in the game. (Well, you can still fix things by accessing the
sealed off CoH - this can be done by trying to get in it from the wrong
direction - and going all the way through it again. Fortunately this time
the Challenge is nearly empty since you already completed it once. After
passing through Blades of Hades again, you get back to the boss wheel. It can't
be turned again, but that doesn't matter - the correct triggers now exist once
again and the boss fight can start when you go back to the boss room.)

Another result is that the cutscene trigger still exists during the boss fight
itself. You can activate the cutscene at a wrong time and create a new
checkpoint during the boss fight, something not normally possible. Unfortunately
this can't be used to your advantage since the boss always heals to full HP if
you retry from checkpoint, and the boss A.I. doesn't become glitched either,
even if you try things like checkpointing while the boss was stunned.

The trigger disappears after the boss fight, and after having fetched the skull
from upstairs, all the doorways become sealed nonetheless.

Trigger skip: if you manipulate where Kratos becomes checkpointed after the
doorway cutscene, you can end up close enough to the boss FMV trigger that you
can skip that one too using black-out time. Beyond the trigger there is just a
big invisible wall, though. Nothing to get excited about, I guess...

Pandora's Guardian
------------------

A.I. glitch: Blind spot Pandora's Guardian has

If you stand at a correct spot during the boss fight, your opponent will get
stuck doing something useless. Basically, get to the higher area where there's
the switch to shoot logs at the Guardian. Stand at the forefront of the higher
platform, find the line which marks the half-way point of it, and stand just
slightly to the right of the line. Now the boss is mostly powerless against
Kratos. (c: GMG)

Videos:
1, GMG's demonstration:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=5Pst3Hm4p3U


Sequence break: skipping all the phases of the fight (c: satvara)

By strategically pulling the switch of the log-shooting device, you can trick
the boss into getting hit by the logs and skip most of the fight this way.

So start the fight by getting to the log-machine as quickly as you can and
pull its switch. The boss will evade and crouch while the log flies over it.
Now, activate the switch again around the time the log is flying over the
boss. Don't spam R2, just press it once. Kratos should start activating the
log machine early, and with correct timing the evading animation of the boss
will glitch up and he will walk straight into the oncoming log. This can be
repeated if you can keep the correct timing up. Basically keep firing a new
log a little after the boss has been hit by the previous log. If your timing
is wrong, the boss just evades the log like normal, and it's hard to recover
from that.

As for the final phase of the boss fight, you can't just shoot another log at
the boss and end the fight early. If you try it, the boss will become immortal
instead. You have to damage the boss first to get his health to orange or lower,
but after that you can skip the rest of the fight using this same trick.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r48QTc01Z8


Sequence break: double lever pull

An older speed tactic. A part of the boss fight is skippable by pulling the
log shooting device's lever twice in a row as the boss is dazed. The boss will
get hit by another log before he can move out of the way, so you don't have to
deplete his health or do the mini-game one extra time.

Using this trick, the bosses armor breaks away differently than it would if you
attacked him normally. (e.g. the breast plate remains to the last part) But
also, the armor breaks differently depending on whether you use this trick on
the first or second phase of the fight.

If you activate double lever pull right before the bosses death's FMV, after
the FMV the machine will click but no log comes out.

Videos:
1, GMG's video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=BSeyrXme38U


Random: If you pull the lever while Pandora's guardian is not stunned, etc.
he will rush to the back of the area and crouches under the flying log.


Other: for some reason Pandora's Guardian can rarely enter a state where he
leans on the log shooting device-platform like usual, but fully steaming -
indicating that he should be mini-gamed next - and he also never does any
attacks at Kratos. Trying to shoot a log has no effect either, it just hits
Pandora's Guardian and disappears.

Videos:
1, Rjsingh Xxx's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b93qZ9Tb8mg


Random: After killing the boss, you get to shoot the log firing device at least
once so that the time does not stop nor camera change.


Trigger skip: You can skip the loading trigger for Army of Hades appearance (and
the small cutscene showing the icon) by doing a massive BoA high jump after the
third lava stream to upstairs. Unfortunately it's useless because none of the
exit doors will open up if you do this. They stay locked like they are during
the boss fight.

It's unknown what would happen if you also used the trigger skip above that
makes the doors stay open... but probably nothing good, since it's likely that
the corridor leading back to Rings is unloaded for now. Also, setting up this
whole skip would take too much time anyway in a speedrun.


"Minotaur's Nest" - save point


Sequence break: After having picked up the skull, there's another in-game scene
at the large hall. You can skip it at least two different ways.

One is to do a decently high BoA high jump towards the wall right of the
stairway. After crossing over, use your double jump to fall back down into the
boss room from above, skipping the cutscene in the process. The good part is
that the big circular descent is also skipped. (c: AKheon)

Other method is going down the circular descent as normal, then doing a small
high jump over the wall to the left right close before hitting the cutscene
trigger. Then just go around the trigger from out of bounds. (c: satvara)

It's not clear which is preferable of the two ways. Depends on the situation,
I guess. The latter method doesn't require PR or BoA, at best.

2, AKheon's video:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=psHSI-0I48Y


Sequence break: skipping Army of Hades

The least resource-intensive way to skip this magic is this: go out of bounds
as detailed above: high jumping over the left-hand wall close to the hole that
Pandora's Guardian made - and carefully inch all the way to the exit to
completely skip getting this magic. However, like all other skips that require
you to move outside bounds for extended periods of time, is not easy to do in
the least. (c: satvara)

You can also escape from the middle of the AoH tutorial fight by jumping over
Hades' face (there's a platform), and then doing another high jump to end up
inside the corridor behind the face. Simple Apollo's High Jumps will suffice.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaruFnfIAcA#t=30


Other: if you skipped the in-game scene at the hall, you can activate it later
during the Army of Hades-fight. It doesn't help much, though. You can even try
to activate it at the same time as Hades starts congratulating you, but the
Hades cutscene seems to override it and no additional glitches seem to happen.


"Chamber of the Gods" - save point
note: behind Muse key door, optional


Random: you can activate the gift of EXP from the ground level which causes the
gift animation to play out displaced.



Rings of Pandora finale
-----------------------

Random: The two skulls (you need to unlock the doors) are not interchangeable.


Camera glitch: If you approach the innermost ring from a bad direction or move
too quickly around it, the camera will move inside the sphere and you can't see
a thing until you move away.


Other: shooting with Eye laser after completing the Rings

Ever wondered what would happen if you pulled the Eye together again after
completing Rings of Pandora? Here's how to do it. Normally the Eye switch
deactivates for good during a timed cutscene after the elevator to the Cliffs
is unlocked. But: if you quickly visit the corridor leading to CoP before this
cutscene, then return, the switches return to place without a cutscene instead.
Now you can quickly grab the switches before they become disabled and hold on
to them even as they sink back into the wall.

But using the switch now does nothing interesting. You just get the generic
reaction of the light shining and ostensibly hitting nothing.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iemyDTrfWc#t=160


Speed strat: you can skip the small speech that Kratos is given as he approaches
the lever used to activate the elevator. Right before the speech trigger, do a
frisk double jump, activate BoA in air and turn left. As you land, tap R2 to
quickly activate the switch as the speech is going on. (c: tyrhhjy)

As a bonus, Kratos regains movement during the elevator ride and thus you save
some seconds at the upper end of the elevator ride as well since you can leave
sooner.

If you're quick enough to jump on top of the stone hands before the elevator
is all the way up, you regain movement during the stone hands scene as well.
It doesn't save time, but can allow slight tomfoolery.

Cliffs of Madness
-----------------

Random: If you try to backtrack while still on the statue's hands, Athena will 
ramble on about your quest.


Random (swimming): If you try to swim back down where you came from, you only
hit insta death floor. Or find unloaded nothingness. There literally is no
return from here (until you have the Box).


Random: I'm not sure what you have to do, but in some circumstances the stone
hands will not rise back up. Instead, they remain as a part of the platform.


Sequence break: You can skip the first Satyr fight by doing a basic high jump
over the fight boundary. The wall is very low, so almost any high jump will
do. (c: Satvara)


Wasted potential: once you beat the first Satyr fight, a checkpoint activates.
If you're close enough to the second fight barrier at the end of the fight,
you're able to use the black-out glitch and skip the following long FMV with it.
Well... it could've been useful for a RTA, but the next area does not load if
you don't view the FMV, so therefore it's not useful at all.

"Cliffs of Madness" - save point


Sequence break: You can skip the short rope section and some travelling by doing
a long jump over the chasm where there are Archers. It is its own art form to
jump over this chasm, and there are so many different ways to do it. Pick your
long jumping style, basically. However, the fastest way to do it involves
grabbing the edge of the cliff opposite to the Archers, and jumping from there
to get a very good speed for your jump.

Videos:
1, satvara's quick variation (at about 0:05)
       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SP9sc2CndY


Strategy: To kill the first bunch of Legionnaires easily, backtrack to the cave
in which there are exp chests (hidden behind a wall). Your enemies can't get to
you!


Strategy: Your enemies can't access the elevators. Use 'em for cheap victory!


Other: Magical elevator activity

If Kratos reaches the upper end of a long elevator section before the elevator
itself, the elevator will catch up and slam up to the upper end instantly,
bringing Kratos up too if he's in the way. This is most noticeable when swimming
up the elevator "shafts".


"The Traps of Madness" - save point


Random: when retrying from the checkpoint in front of the large doorway,
sometimes the Legionnaires will not spawn in the area to the left.


Sequence break: normally you have to go through a big cave and fight there to
get to an elevator that leads you to Traps of Madness and later the Necklace
of Aphrodite. However, by using high and long jumps later on, you can skip both
of the Necklaces, and therefore there is no need to go by the cave.

But in the past, a speedrunner wanted at least one of the Necklaces to extend
the bridge a little bit. Necklace of Aphrodite was pretty fast to get since
you could skip the big cave regardless by doing a long jump from the area where
you can descend the stone block and rope from above. Find the spot where the
left side invisible wall ends, then do a long jump to reach the elevator that
leads to Traps of Madness. Be warned that the death floor is pretty high in
this area, and your long jump has to be carefully timed for it to work.
(c: Satvara)

Videos:
1, Satvara's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIHOf6OAQc#t=108


Sequence break: You can reach Necklace of Aphrodite without activating the trap
mechanism using a high jump. Afterwards the cutscene showing the area looks a
bit strange, as the open gate will instantly appear closed and then opens up
again. (c: Satvara)


Random: if you glitch up the Necklace of Aphrodite-prompt by entering Start-
or Select-menu, then pick up the third invisible option that comes in the menu,
Kratos doesn't freeze as usual. However, the camera does not return to its
normal position afterwards.

The same probably works with Necklace of Hera as well. ยง


Out of bounds: if you BoA high jump over the back wall where the Necklace of
Aphrodite is, you'll fall into the half-unloaded fight room you had to pass
through earlier. Camera is wonky and graphics invisible until you manage to
roll back to the path leading downstairs, after which visibility improves. Not
very useful, since you sequence break backwards in the level instead of forward.

If you do the BoA jump on top of the Necklace indention instead and from there
double jump onward, Kratos falls down a shorter length into an area closer to
the start of the level, mostly unloaded.

You might be able to reach the rotating room this way too, but it's unlikely
it would be helpful speed-wise since the existing strategies are already quite
good, and you'd have to go out of your way to reach Necklace of Aphrodite.


Random: "Just to note it, if you get Aphrodite's Necklace before Hera's (no
backtracking needed) you will probably have used the rope with a block on the
way down... so the "lever" past Hera's puzzle will instead be an EXP chest."
- GMG


Sequence break: wall clip to get past the rotating bridge

You can go inside the wall to the left of the first big doorway by getting
behind the assorted items where there's the wooden bucket and a larger board
leaning against the cliffs. Once you're behind the board, jump and do air grabs
against it, aiming towards down and left, so that Kratos slowly goes deeper into
the wall. Now you're in danger off falling off the map because there's not much
ground beneath you. End your fall with PR and hope that your positioning and
timing let you stop inside the wall in a correct way. The next step is Apollo's
Ascension. Once AA starts, steer it deep into the wall... You should find
yourself beyond the second rotating platform now. (c: Satvara)

So you've skipped a part of the level... there's only a matter of a loading
trigger to take care of. The trigger is little to the south of the second bridge
platform. It can be scathed by doing a long jump variant over the long chasm,
then turning around in the middle of the jump to land back safely to the second
platform. Satvara does it this way: Apollo's Long jump with two AOs, then an
air square attack. Jump back towards the platform, two AO's and Hermes Stomp.
It's easier (but slower) to do with a BoA long jump, though.

Notes:
- if the enemies are a bother, you can distract them momentarily with AoH, or
  rely on the glitch where the enemies don't spawn.

unreasonably slow alternative to the above wall clip skip.

Collision flaw: One of the ladders is glitched-up, causing Kratos to get sorta
stuck on top of it. I think you can jump out of it, if it happens.


Random: After picking up the Necklace of Hera, doing a roll will land Kratos
to his death. For some reason the game will kill you as long as the camera
hasn't reverted back to the default position.


Sequence break: skip both necklaces

You can do a jump over the extending bridge without getting either of the
necklaces. Blades high jumps are so far the fastest way to cross the chasm,
but BoA flash jump is not too shabby for this purpose either. (c: satvara)

There even exists a way to cross the bridge with only Blades, although you need
lv. 4 Blades for this purpose. If you start LAM on the elevated ground beyond
the bridge and use the L1+triangle attack to do a special high jump, Kratos
rises high enough to get on the bridge. (c: AKheon)

Sequence break: another alternative to skipping both necklaces is to do a huge
BoA jump from the ground level to the ropes above, then go hit the loading
trigger to the next area from the wrong direction. The good part is that this
route skips the long FMV showing Kratos' past automatically - worth it in a
RTA. The bad part is that the jump is indeed uncomfortably big, and might not
be practical to do in a real speed run, or without PR.

Swimming glitch: If you go inside the cave past the extending bridge, there's
a tunnel of water. You can do swimming glitch here rather effortlessly by doing
a BoA jump over the wall and touching the water out of bounds. Doing swimming
glitch here is less useful than you'd think, though... This is the last spot
in the game where there's water in a long while, and you get stuck at the Box
since you can't end swimming glitch in a timely manner.

Another way to get swimming is to go into the cave leading to Necklace of Hera.
After a fight starts and the gate closes behind you, do a BoA jump on top of
the gate and from on top jump to the side to fall out of bounds. Then continue
BoA jumping until you can hit the water surface on the floor and start swimming.

The Architect's Tomb
--------------------

Collision flaw: If you do BoA's air triangle attack to a correct spot near the
coffins in the twisty corridor right before the tomb, Kratos will fall down
through the floor. Not really useful, but... (not sure who discovered this.)


"The Architect's Tomb" - save point


Various: Cerberi fight glitches

- Launching a grown Cerberus inside the corridor can cause it to get stuck at
roof level.
- For some reason, if grown Cerberi go near the broken ladder to the north-east
of the floor symbol, they can sometimes lose their A.I. and just stand there.
- BoA's homerun techniques can send a Cerberus far outside the battle arena.
- If a Cerberus is lured or forced on the breakable stone floor at the ground
level, it will start endlessly falling against it. If you now drop the stone
block on the stone floor, the Cerberi will unexist.

Other: if you drop the stone block on the pushable statue, the stone block will
become suspended in mid-air. You will also find an invisible rope under the
stone block that Kratos can uselessly climb.

Sequence break: skip Architect's Tomb

Instead of doing the puzzle here, high jump your way to freedom! This area is
pretty allowing when it comes to jump skips, so there are many skip options
and approaches to choose from.

First do a series of high jumps to get to the top level. In my opinion getting
to top level is faster from the right side. You can use a small jump like a PR
high jump to get to the 2nd floor, and from there use the crane's stone block
for jumping up to the 3rd floor.

For doing the rest of the jump from the right side, break into the small room
with a chest in it. Then get on top of the left chest. First get LAM with
forward running momentum to get as high as possible using only one jump. Then,
near the top of the wall use your second jump and continue with BoA air attacks.
Let Kratos fall a short while once out of bounds to prevent him from landing to
the upper floor by accident... then finish the jump with fuse glitch and Stomp
to land into the corridor safely. It takes a bit of blind platforming, but is
not generally too difficult to do.

Alternatively, from the right side you can start a high jump from outside the
room to land inside the Tomb while still remaining out of bounds. And from there
you can do a long jump to reach the other side of the locked gate, or just do
the rest of the Tomb normally if you want less risk. (c: exe)

You can also do this skip from the left side with similar tactics. It's a
matter of opinion whether it's easier, since the camera is different.

An alternative method to do the Architect's Tomb skip with less challenging
high jumps was found by Ragnell56. Drag the statue on ground level close to
the gate that leads inside the Tomb. After it is in a specific spot, go behind
it so that Kratos is in between the statue and the gate. Then do BoA Flash jump
to get to roof level. There is a ledge / floor there that Kratos can get pushed
on, from where you can jump inside the tomb.

You can do a variation of the final method in a low% run with only Blades too.

Random: GMG reports that it's not possible to crush the Cyclops using the block.


"Zeus Mountain" - save point


Sequence break: You can skip the small cutscene at the entrance of the conveyor
belt room by doing a high jump. (c: satvara)

Without PR you have to adapt a small BoA flash jump for this purpose. Try to
be careful to not steer Kratos too much to the sides or he'll fall down into
a chasm.

Videos:
1, Satvara's vid:
        http://youtube.com/watch?v=Kne4ZOF_Vcs


Sequence break: conveyor belt skip

If you run by the very edge of the area, you can go around the fight trigger
which makes Harpies appear. This is a bit tricky because of the moving floor.

An alternative way to skip this fight is to activate it, then do a quick high
jump over the fight barrier blocking the exit.

One third method is to use a high jump to get on top of the conveyor belt
itself. You don't need a very high jump to get on top of some walkable floor.
(c: atrexthiswork)

The original skip was actually one of the earliest known tricks for this game,
discovered as far back as 2006 by Vortex72 at the GameFAQs board.

Pandora's Box
-------------

Sequence break: skip using the elevator

Do a BoA high jump over the wall of the staircase and make sure to drop inside
the wall. From there navigate closer to the elevator while staying out of
bounds. Some jump variations can't be used here because the camera goes bonkers
if you go too far away from the corridor, so try to keep it basic. Satvara's
original method is just a double jump aligned with the corridor, landing inside
the corridor's wall for a moment, and from there another double jump to reach
the elevator shaft. It's not easy to do reliably. (c: satvara)

An alternative method involves jumping on top of the door you'd normally kick
open. Turn Kratos a little to not fall down from on top of the door when
switching weapons to BoA. Start LAM and do a high jump over the wall to the
side and just drop down close enough to the elevator. As a bonus this skip can
be easily done without PR. (c: AKheon)

After descending enough, you get the next cutscene in which the elevator
descends like normal with Kratos and the Box on it.

Videos:

2, AKheon's alternative skip
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBesUaOFbYY


Other: If you had skipped the cutscene which shows you around the conveyour
belt, the door to the Box room will only glitch up if you kick it. It looks to
be closed but you can walk right through it.


Other: A small-term music glitch happens here. If you skip the aforementioned
cutscene, you will hear Zeus Mountain's music in the background even after the
conveyor belt. After you kick open the door, you will also start hearing the
Box theme music. Unfortunately either of the overlapping songs will carry on
if you decide to quit the game (unlike what happens in the real music glitch).


Other: Not loaded?

GMG said that sometimes the Box is not loaded when you get to the correct room.
I guess it's not too common. I've heard it will load if you just retry from the
latest checkpoint.


Random: Before you have descended with the elevator, you can move Pandora's Box
around using a well-placed Hermes Stomp. I wonder why? Strange... This property
disappears after you've rode the elevator down too.


Wasted potential: If you're swimming, you get stuck because you have no way to
end the swimming and Pandora's Box can't be moved like this.


Other info: about the level structure

Most of the Rings of Pandora and also the outer parts of Pandora's Temple are
permanently unloaded at this stage. The main gate's crank exists, but it might
not be possible to reach it right now, unless swimming.


Sequence break: skip Hades cutscene (c: atrexthiswork)

You normally have to watch a 4-minute cutscene after pushing the box before the
game continues from Hades. This can be skipped in certain circumstances.

Apparently, you have to line up the Pandora's Box very carefully so that when
you give it one last kick, it barely hits the Hades cutscene trigger. After
kicking it, Kratos has to roll backwards twice; you then have to spam 'O' as
fast as you can.

I still haven't tried this trick out myself, but both SpeedMartyr and
NoobsGamers give instructions like above for doing this trick. This can be done
fairly consistently once you get the basic setup right.

Hades
-----

"The Path of Hades" - save point

Speed strategy: you can save navigation time by doing a long jump to one of
the later platforms. After reaching the twist in the path with one Archer on it,
you can do a an Apollo's Long Jump to the platform in the background to skip
going around via some extra rotating pillars.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SP9sc2CndY#t=52


"Styx Below" - save point


Speed strategy: it takes luck, but you can brave the Archers during the moving
platform section and just keep on moving as quickly as possible. Casting Army
of Hades is also a good aid for distracting the Archers.


Sequence break: skip a fight before the rotating spike pillar

Do a BoA high jump near the 1st spiked pillar to get on top of the red fight
barrier. From there you get a good head-start to the whole climbing process too,
in addition to having skipped a fight. (c: satvara)

Videos:
1, an excerpt from Vipeazone's speed run:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Z2u0fzpxM#t=937


Collision flaw: sometimes the spiked pillars can drop Kratos through collision
and into his death. Usually this happens if you get hit multiple times while
falling down. (thank to TheNinjaPiglet for reminding)


Wasted potential: you can reach the Satyr fight platform from the wrong
direction by doing a high jump from on top of the chest path to the right.
However, if you do this, nothing is loaded on the fight platform. And it looks
like nothing is loaded further on in the level either.


Speed strategy: instead of killing every Satyr the game throws at you to rise
all the platforms, it's possible to do a long jump after a certain point. You
can get across after only killing 8 to 10 Satyrs, depending on how you want to
do your long jump.

This might be an useful speed tip in any category since the last Satyrs only
spawn after a delay.

Videos:
1, an excerpt from Vipeazone's speed run:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Z2u0fzpxM#t=969


Other: if you upgrade your Blades to Lv. 2 for the first time here, you won't
hear Athena's "Rage of the Gods"-voiceclip for some reason.


Sequence break: skip meeting Gravedigger (c: AKheon)

You can skip the pre-rendered video of Gravedigger talking to Kratos, which
is good in a run aiming for real time.

Whilst climbing out of Hades, jump off the rope to the left but interrupt your
flight with PR to drop down at the very edge of the grave. If done right, Kratos
hits ground for just a moment, enough to activate a new checkpoint while still
avoiding activating the upcoming cutscene. Then just enter your menu and upgrade
Blades, retry and roll past the cutscene trigger... not a hard skip to do.

Without PR the skip becomes more unreliable to do. For now the best setup
involves doing a Stomp to back-left or another direction from the grave. There
is more ground there Kratos can land on without the cutscene activating. And
even if you do manage to land in a way that starts the cutscene, retry usually
takes Kratos a bit closer to the grave so that black-out glitch is still doable.

Incidentally, we never even see Gravedigger in a speedrun with all these skips.

Temple of the Oracle revisit
----------------------------

"Oracle's Temple (destroyed)" - save point


Sequence break: You can skip the fight at what was once the Harpy puzzle room
by getting onto a ledge on the left side of the wall and jumping over the fight
trigger in a devious manner. It is not difficult, once you learn the needed
movement. (c: satvara)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iemyDTrfWc#t=11


Random: all the enemies here have reduced HP to give the player a more
powerful feeling.


"Final Battle" - save point


Strategy: you can cast Army of Hades before entering the final boss area and
replenish your magic using the chests nearby. This way you get a completely free
AoH cast and extra damage for the final boss. Of course if you have regen magic
doing this is not as important. (thanks to RAZOR0018)

Also, AoH that is cast before meeting Ares lasts much longer than an AoH cast
during the Ares fight. It seems that AoH is nerfed during the last battles of
the game, making each cast last an extra short time.



Ares 1
------

Random: Some kind of mechanism makes Kratos unable to spam Zeus' Fury too much
during this fight. If he shoots too many in a row, the bolts will simply stop
appearing for some reason temporarily. (well, might be many reasons for it)


Random: Ares may get the mini-game circle over his head while he is flying up
in the air, in which case it will promptly go to waste.


Strategy: You can abuse Ares' death minigame to gather orbs pretty well. First,
get his circle to appear and activate the minigame. Succeed in the first two
prompts, but in the third, let Kratos fail. Kratos receives 1000 orbs and takes
no damage. You can repeat this as much as you want.

Also, if Ares has exactly 0 HP, a mere grab at him will make him go into the
mini-game stun again, and you can repeat the above almost instantly! Even
cheaper. (thanks GMG)

Videos:
1, addaminsain's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h76QRUlhhrw


Strategy: A single Zeus' Fury bolt will get Ares' ass down whenever he is
doing his aerial magic thingy. Intentional or not?


Strategy: Do a high jump over the walls for a very safe fight. Ares can't reach
you at all, and you may even activate swimming glitch using the water all around
the place (although that is useless).



Kratos clones fight
-------------------

Random: defeating the Kratos clone fight on God-difficulty and without upgrades
is known to be a ridiculously difficult challenge. Only a few people in the
world have successfully done this - among the first were Shinobier and Manu918.

For intense watching, check out Shinobier's video of his fight where he also
refused to use any magics - a run variant called Pain.

Videos:
1, shinobier's vid:
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRrT5PN9W98


Other: Kratos' family shenanigans

The family's position is prone to changing as the battle progresses. Sometimes
attacked clones can push it to some direction. Sometimes it moves when Kratos
hugs them in certain circumstances. I've heard they can also move if Kratos hugs
them while being grabbed himself by a clone.

The family can be moved off the game map. On easy they will lose 50% of their
health while remaining completely safe for the rest of the fight, but on harder
difficulties they will die. However, it is still desirable to deliberately
move the family, even if just a little to the back, because it's a safer place
for them than their initial location. The easiest way to move the family is to
use Gorgon Rage, then instantly afterwards hug them. It can also help to be on
a different height than the family is. Of course this tactic is very magic
costly and not worth it without infinite or regen magic... (c: AKheon)

At the beginning of 2009, manu918 and co. worked a new way for doing the glitch,
this time suitable for No Upgrade Run-purposes. It is by merely freezing clones,
then grabbing the family. So, while it's not easy to say what is the exact cause
of this phenomena, it seems to happen especially in conjuction with stonefrozen
enemies... But yeah, on harder difficulties and when doing challenge runs, it
can save your life to move the family a little.

If the family has fallen down, some clones might run after them and suicide
themselves foolishly. Also, new clone spawns are prone to move in slow motion
for some reason eventually.

2, Manu918's video of moving family without Gorgon Rage:
       http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gd4tfP70J70


Random: there is a model of the family in t-pose floating in mid-air a little
to the south of the fight arena. You can get there with some long / high jumps.
It's possible to stand on the family... and nothing much else.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwAWfVhQqDk#t=203


Random: there are in fact 101 Kratos clones total that spawn during the fight.
This is ignoring the lightning Kratos clones who are optional to kill and will
spawn infinitely if you attack them.


Other: New clone spawns will sometimes move in extreme slow motion without a
particular reason. This can happen in conjunction with the Kratos' family
moving glitch, but it can also happen without it.


Other: Kratos' family will bleed heavily if you do Gorgon Rage, even though
they receive no damage.


Collision flaw: The small altar behind Kratos' family can be accessed from
behind. Wait until the brick wall disappears, then just run inside.


Random: The platforms will start to deteriorate even if you don't kill any of
the clones.


Random: You can't hug yourself to death except in some random circumstances.
By this I mean hugging the family when Kratos is very low on health.


Random: By dying of a clone, or because your family loses their HP, you receive
a special death cutscene.


Random: If you die by the special death cutscene, you will never get the prompt
to lower the difficulty afterwards.


Strategy: Cast Army of Hades the last possible moment in this fight. The flying
souls will follow you to the next fight, in which you can't cast spells, giving
you a small edge.



Ares 2
------

Camera glitch: At random times, the camera starts at a "bad location", but it
later fixes itself.


Random: If you go to the menu, you'll find that all magics are locked. If you
press X, the game further elaborates: "Ares has stolen your magic."


Random: If you use the menu glitch which messes up the graphics, you might
encounter a glitch item which requires '10000' to upgrade. Of course you can't
funnel orbs into it...


Speed strategy: especially on easy / Tycoonius, you can finish off Ares 2 very
quick if he decides to start off with his rock slam attack. Stay at the center
of the screen to manipulate the rocks to appear harmlessly near the center. You
get tons of free hits in during his attack. GMG also suggested to use Hades'
Gift special attack against Ares during this time. ยง

If you want a good start to the fight, you can keep retrying from last
checkpoint until Ares starts with the rock slam.


Wasted potential: if you upgrade Blades to Lv. 2 during the cutscene at the end
of Kratos clone fight and get the Rage of the Gods-tutorial message on your
screen as the first thing as the Ares 2 fight starts, you can enter Start-menu
and see that all your magics and regular moves are still there. Yes, you start
the fight with your regular arsenal! But as soon as you close the message, you
lose it all and are stuck with the Blade of the Gods.


Random: The move list for the Blade of the Gods contains only 4 moves, all of
which are unique to this sword. Otherwise it acts almost like BoA. Another
difference is that it doesn't have a launch/lift-up move, or so it seems.


Random: In this battle the gravity has been changed so that you can never jump
very high.


Swimming glitch: you can accidentally get swimming glitch in this part. One way
I personally have got it is by getting hit by Ares' rock slam attack in a
certain part of the map. This causes Kratos to do rocket in air while swimming
pose.

You can leave the map if you want while swimming, which makes the fight arena
and the health bar HUD to unload. When approaching the map again, the Blade of
the Gods appears in Kratos' hand even though he is swimming, which looks odd.
Kratos can't do swim grabs right now for some reason. I'm not sure if you have
any way of damaging Ares right now, like doing swim dashes against him.

If Kratos gets hit by Ares' attacks like this, he has no reaction animation.
Instead the regular HUD that has now re-appeared glitches up and Kratos' health
meter overflows. But this doesn't stop him dying like usual once the boss fight
HUD shows his health depleting. There's probably nothing useful you can do with
swimming glitch in this map, but it's a curious thing to try out, if you manage
to make it happen.


Other: For either loading or mini-game related reasons, Ares' death might at
times get delayed a bunch. He slowly rises up if he was mini-gamed and then does
nothing for a short while until the ending FMV kicks in.


Other: Probably due to a loading glitch, Ares can turn into an insubstantial
'holographic statue' instead of dying like he should.



Mount Olympus + Suicide Bluffs
------------------------------

You won the game. Congratulations.


Random: You have Athena's Blades, for some reason exactly the same as Blades of
Chaos, except of a different color. They are also automatically level 5 as you
get them.


Random: Despite the in-game statement about gods not letting Kratos die on that
victorious day, you CAN get yourself killed. They're keeping an eye only on that
particular cliff, you see.

Go and high jump over the pile of rubble, and you can access lower regions of
the Suicide Bluffs. There's nothing you can do since there are no loading
triggers leading anywhere else. All you really can do is just fall down to your
doom.


"Olympus" - save point


Don't forget the two statues in the throne room which you can climb on top of
or demolish. The game will not display the number of hits (other than with a
couple of moves) but just keep at it. Eventually, after both statues have been
crushed, an easter egg is revealed.

L2 the throne to end the game. Interestingly, even on this occasion, after
having "won", Kratos may emit his death sound on game exit. It really wasn't
a happy ending...

You get to access normal game many times between ending FMVs. You can upgrade
weapons, etc. It doesn't seem to be useful in any way, though.

Well, for a RTA speedrunner it might be useful to retry afterwards to be able
to save and see the in-game time of his run.



New Game+ ?
-----------

Right after having finished watching the ending FMVs, start a new game. Open
the weapons menu on the first possible occasion. You will see you still have all
your gathered weapons and magic, except they're lv. 1, and you have no orbs.
You also have relics like Poseidon's Trident. Neat, eh? If only they didn't
disappear very quickly afterwards, as the first cutscene ends...

Note: It seems this happens whenever starting a New Game after having loaded a
game before. No need to play through the game.



Character Graveyard
-------------------

Collision flaw: You can get yourself killed by falling through the floor. Doing
ascension against the pillar wall past one of the rejected skeleton models
works. It's just to the left where you start from.

If you die five times in the Character Graveyard, the game will ask if you want
to switch difficulty. This choice probably doesn't matter, then the game takes
you back to the Graveyard.

Videos:

Other: you can press X and triangle at the same time while entering the
Character Graveyard (or Challenges) to return to main menu while the screen
fades out. Unfortunately this can't be used to do new glitches because you
can't select things with X while the screen is fading out.



Challenge of the Gods
---------------------

- Random: The ballista challenge can be finished without using the ballista by
  doing a BoA long jump to the other platform and defeating your opponents
  manually. Rage of the Gods must be used so that Kratos does not run out of
  magic during the long jump.

  for you to get your ass kicked.



# Misc. info
-------------

"In-game timer"

Here is a rundown on when it runs and when it does not. You may be surprised
from the results!

When retrying (whether by death OR retry), the game clock is reverted back to
the time the game checkpointed you. This means you don't lose any in-game time.

In pause-screen (select), no time runs at all.

In weapon/item screen (start), no time runs at all.

While in the save-screen, no time runs at all.

During FMV-cutscenes no time runs.

During in-game cutscenes time does run.
