# Introduction

It's about time God of War: Ascension got its own Glitch FAQ. So what is a Glitch FAQ? It's basically a written file that contains plenty of detailed knowledge on a game's mechanics, especially the unintended things more commonly known as glitches or bugs. Most of the info here is of use to enthusiasts and speedrunners, and in specific cases to normal gamers who have become caught up in the whirlwind of a game breaking bug. So, let's get cracking...

Note: this guide concerns single player only, and most of the things in it have been tested and tried only on the unpatched version. Things may vary in unforeseen ways if you've patched your game.


## Abbreviations

NG = New Game
NG+ = New Game+

c: = credits to
ยง = note to self / to be re-written or verified


## Glossary

air momentum = air momentum refers to how much vertical or horizontal velocity Kratos has when he is in air. For instance, he has the best possible vertical air momentum at the start of a double jump when he is still rising upwards and bad vertical air momentum when he starts losing height and falls down. Understanding air momentum is important if you want to perform effective high jumps in this game.

angled collision = for example, some floor that makes Kratos slide off if he tries to stand on it.

break-out = this is a type of a glitch where Kratos breaks free of a dedicated animation or cutscene. The results are usually strange looking and potent.

buffering = this term is usually heard in fighting game context and can have many meanings. But for the purposes of this FAQ, it just basically means inputting another move to follow a first move, like when doing a combo.

high jump = doing a jump that is higher than the developers intended. It's a basic glitching tactic in the action-adventure genre, and even simple high jumps can have surprisingly destructive results.

long jump = along the same lines, doing a jump that is longer than what the developers intended.

infinite jump = a jump technique that allows you to gain in theory infinite height. This kind of techniques usually break a game, and are well sought after. At the time of writing, however, God of War: Ascension is the only main God of War-title to not have an infinite jump tactic.

out of bounds (or OoB) = going outside the intended boundaries of the level.

t-pose = a basic modelling pose for a 3d-character. Kratos enters it if certain types of break-outs are done. In a well programmed video game, the player should never see this pose.


## Fastest speed records of God of War: Ascension?

This game hasn't been that popular among speedrunners thus far, and it's not a surprise considering it has a ton of unskippable cutscenes as well as game breaking glitches that can end a run in an instant. The key tricks are also very precise to pull off...

For real time-attack (RTA) runs, please see speedrun.com leaderboards for this game:

There also exists one segmented New Game-run, made by a Chinese player whose name I don't know. The full run may not be viewable anywhere, but below there's a narrated "best moments" compilation that shows the most important tricks and tactics that have been used. Overall it's a pretty good run, and also one that showcased some completely new tricks when it came out, so it's referenced many times through this FAQ.

# Basic techniques

## Double jump slightly higher

A small, occasionally useful mechanic in both God of War III and Ascension. The game thinks Kratos has hit ground a little before he actually lands, allowing you to start a new double jump from slightly in air. This is useful for getting a bit more height when using any jump variation that starts from a regular jump.

## Unarmed Jump

Unarmed Jump is a very basic high jump that can be done from the start of the game. For some reason the Unarmed air attack reacts to Kratos' current air momentum quite strongly. So if you do this attack right after double jumping, when your vertical air momentum is at its highest, Kratos will fly in a surprisingly high arc through the air. This is already enough to go over some low walls around the game.

You can also use continuous Unarmed air attacks for long jumping over large chasms. Although the attack makes Kratos lose height rapidly, he bounces back a bit at the end of each attack as long as you still have positive air momentum left. If you have double jump available, you can also use that after an Unarmed air attack to completely reset your vertical air momentum and get even further.

Since the attack is so incredibly reactive to Kratos' existing velocity, it becomes especially powerful for fast movement if you do it from the lowest point of a swinging grapple point, since that's when Kratos' horizontal velocity is at its highest.

If there is angled collision beneath Kratos, it will support him and help him stay in air longer while doing continuous Unarmed Jump even though he cannot stand on it.

God of War-games usually feature hidden ledges that Kratos can use to gain more height or go out of bounds. However, Kratos can't grab those while doing Unarmed Jump, which limits its use somewhat.

You can remove the cooldown when landing from Unarmed Jump by pressing R1 (doing "passive" tether) in air right before the Unarmed attack. This can save half a second if you ever use Unarmed Jump for platforming around the game, but keep in mind that you can't steer Kratos in air any longer if you start your jump with a passive tether.

This jump is mostly obsoleted by Shield Jump as soon as you manage to grab a Shield for Kratos in Chapter 7.


## Shield Jump

The Shield Jump is a basic but very effective high jump technique. The Shield air attack is basically the same as the Unarmed air attack, except with steroids. It's even more reactive to Kratos' current momentum and is therefore better for both high jumping and long jumping.

Almost all of the same rules of Unarmed Jump apply to Shield Jump as well, including the way you can do it continuously to cross over large chasms. However, you cannot do the Shield air attack during passive tether, which means that you cannot interrupt its cooldown upon landing like with Unarmed Jump.

The worst part about Shield Jump is that you can't get a Shield until Chapter 7. You also won't be able to grab hidden ledges around the game with this technique. Other than that, this is Kratos' go-to high jump technique for most of the game in both NG and NG+ categories.

Another unique difference between Shield Jump and Unarmed Jump is that Shield Jump can be extended by upgrading in certain conditions. See the section about Upgrade Jump for more information.

## Shield Discard Jump (c: AKheon)

If you discard your Shield in air, then press circle during the discard animation, Kratos buffers an unloaded Shield air attack where his air momentum stays fixed for a few seconds. This means that any positive air momentum you have also becomes locked for a few seconds, allowing you to fly upward in air a decent length. Afterwards, you can start spamming Unarmed air attacks to make the jump even longer.

If you do Shield Discard from your first jump, you are able to use your second jump in air afterwards and increase the versatility of this technique.

As you might imagine, doing this jump makes you lose your Shield, which is a huge drawback. It's also difficult to gain exceptional height with this jump unless you combine it with other techniques like LAM (Lenient Air Momentum, there's more about it below). It works particularly well for long jumping, especially on NG+, where this is the best long jump that exists.

## Poseidon Tremble high jump (c: findlestick)

This is one of the oldest jump tricks found in Ascension. The Poseidon Tremble high jump is a small, mostly NG+ viable way of gaining limited height. Start from a double jump, then quickly follow the second jump with Poseidon Tremble (air) interrupted with Ice Rage. Kratos gets some extra height from the two attacks. If you had any horizontal momentum, you also move forward in air a little during Ice Rage.

Poseidon Tremble high jump works quite well together with Broken Destiny jump for even more height gain. However, you should note that Poseidon Tremble stops being useful as a finisher once your air momentum gets too bad, so this technique has its limitations.

Also, Ice Rage can be difficult to use as a finisher if there are any enemies nearby since Kratos tends to auto-target towards them.

## Broken Destiny jump (c: findlestick)

Broken Destiny (air) is an air move that has almost zero air momentum loss while doing it. So if you alternate it with Falling Helios (air), Kratos actually gains height. But only for a brief time - after a while his air momentum worsens and worsens until he starts losing height. But even though this trick has huge limits, it's still a handy trick to know in the first half of the game.

This jump becomes far more effective once you get Amulet of Uroborus in Chapter 13. Using the Amulet, you can interrupt the cooldown of Falling Helios (air), maximizing the possible height gain you can squeeze out of these two attacks before Kratos' air momentum becomes too bad to gain height. This jump tactic is potentially more powerful than a Shield Jump, although the optimal timing can be difficult to learn. It certainly doesn't help that the button for using Amulet is a finicky shoulder button with multiple levels of responsiveness.

One common problem is that when trying to do the jump motions as fast as possible, Kratos starts casting Amulet of Uroborus in air, ruining the whole jump. On NG+ it may help to turn the artefact Stonemason's Chisel off to slow cooldown time and in general always be mindful of when Kratos is able to cast Certain Destiny. However, with enough practice this ceases to be a big problem.

If you reset your air momentum using a double jump or some rare attack like Sling discard, it's possible to continue doing the jump motions a bit longer before Kratos starts to lose height.

Broken Destiny jump also doubles as a decent if somewhat slow long jump since Kratos slowly inches forward in air while doing it. But you need to have a good horizontal air momentum when you start the jump, so begin doing the jump motions from a running jump.

## Falling Helios high jump (c: AKheon)

This is a cheaper variation of Broken Destiny jump that is relevant in both NG and NG+ categories. Basically, you can replace Broken Destiny (air) in the Broken Destiny high jump with a normal Blades air attack. This makes you lose slightly more air momentum, but performing the jump becomes much faster. This variation of the jump can also be done without any Ice-element upgrades.

To perform this jump, you need to keep triangle held down all the time. Jump in air, then do Blades air s1. Kratos should then automatically buffer Falling Helios afterwards if you're holding down triangle. If you have Amulet, you can then press L2 to skip most of the Falling Helios animation and spare some of your air momentum to get much more height.

The most minimalist version of this jump, which is mostly relevant in the very early chapters of the game, uses neither Amulet or Poseidon Tremble as a finisher. You instead just do the main cycle of this jump twice, then finish the jump with air tether. Tether is a fairly decent finisher to a high jump, since mechanically it interrupts Falling Helios while giving a surprising amount of height too if you have good positive air momentum. It's more nimble to use compared to Ice Rage, although it can also auto-target any nearby enemies and mess up your jump's direction.

Using tether as a finisher is an option for other variants of high jumps as well which use Falling Helios to gain height.

## Upgrade Jump (c: findlestick)

For some reason, certain upgrades force the game to reload the data for Kratos' current world weapon. This means that for a second or two, Kratos is in a state where he has a world weapon but it doesn't have any animation data available, and therefore all its attacks lack most of their normal properties. Any attack that is currently in progress will interrupt, returning Kratos to a neutral t-pose. Any new attacks that are buffered have no animation properties and basically look like Kratos standing in place and grunting with (usually) no other discernible effects.

This odd loophole can be used in high jumping. The simplest form of an Upgrade Jump is to break out from a world weapon attack in air. For instance, you could do an ascension to get more than a double jump's worth of height, then start a world weapon attack, upgrade to break out of it, then follow up with your double jump to get even more height.

An obvious limitation is that you only have a finite amount of Upgrade Jumps available in a speedrun. Also, this jump is only possible in NG-categories since on NG+ you already start out with everything maxed out and cannot upgrade anything.

A less obvious limitation is that this loophole is level-specific. You see, in areas that have sub-weapons, the data for any specific sub-weapon that is possible to pick up is already passively loaded. So, for instance, if a Sword can be found in some map, that means you can't break out of Sword attacks by upgrading. If you try, the sub-weapon only becomes invisible for a moment, but nothing stranger than that happens. So in this regard, it could be argued that the more common sub-weapons are less useful for upgrade jumps since there are fewer locations where they can be broken out of. In practical terms, however, Shield is really the superior sub-weapon for any kind of upgrade jumps 99% of the time simply because of its bizarre properties (read more below).

As for instructions for Upgrade jump... well, the whole mechanism behind this jump is to some extent unknown. The easiest way to enable this jump on a New Game playthrough is to not upgrade anything except Blades to lv. 3. A break-out happens if you then upgrade Blades to lv. 4 and quickly exit the menu. Other upgrades or upgrade combinations may cause it to happen too, but this hasn't been tested systematically.


## Sky Jump (c: findlestick)

Being able to break out of world weapon attacks in air is convenient, but the real power of Upgrade Jump can only be unleashed using the Shield with a so-called "Sky Jump". The air attack of Shield has very peculiar properties and it gives a massive boost to Kratos' vertical velocity. If you use the upgrading loop-hole to do an unloaded Shield air attack, Kratos will quickly ascend in air during the few seconds all of his momentum is fixed. Afterwards, he even returns completely neutral, allowing him to grab ledges or use his double jump, resulting in what is for most intents and purposes THE most powerful and versatile high jump tactic in the entire game.

You can start the Sky Jump from the highest point of a Shield Jump, which gives you a large head start as far as height gain is concerned.

The only drawback is that, as mentioned, there is only a finite amount of upgrade break-outs available in a single playthrough of the game, and you can only do this on NG categories.

## Air-run (c: findlestick, AKheon)

Another powerful use for an upgrade break-out is an "air-run". If you do an upgrade break-out and then press X and O simultaneously while running, Kratos enters a curious looking high-speed sprint animation while levitating through the air. Apparently, this is the result of the world weapon's unloaded air attack combining with the first frames of Kratos' jump with quite unique results.

This can be done with all world weapons, although with most world weapons the results aren't particularly impressive - Kratos just runs in air for a few seconds at a slightly elevated speed. However, as usual, Shield is in a league of its own here. An air-run with Shield allows Kratos to do a very high speed run which also getting a height boost that is almost comparable to a Sky Jump. This is bar none the best long jump tactic in the game, although again, it's only available on New Game and there are only a finite amount of upgrades available for Kratos.

Findlestick originally discovered but never published this trick, since he thought it could only happen randomly in areas with mild slopes on the ground. But later in 2023, I found that it can be done consistently by just using the input X + O while running, thus making this a consistent and useful technique.

## Ledge Magnetism (c: findlestick, AKheon)

Poseidon Tremble (air) makes Kratos latch onto specific kind of "magnetic ledges" either above or below him for an unknown reason. To do this, you have to move Kratos to a location next to a magnetic ledge, then do Poseidon Tremble (air) facing towards it. Kratos' height and positive air momentum seem to matter to a degree. If the glitch happens, Kratos is immediately scooped up or down (depending on location) and starts hanging from the magnetic ledge.

This only happens at some very select spots around the game, and there is no way to know where exactly without trying. They usually seem to be out of bounds pieces of geometry that the player is never supposed to access and for which there are no visual cues either. It's a mystery why this glitch happens in the first place... and it only gets stranger from here.

One of the easiest places to try this glitch out is at The Martyr's Chamber. Start Chapter 17, then run to the right side of the cage, into the cramped nook between it and a wall, and do Poseidon Tremble (air) against the back wall from a double jump. Kratos should pretty much always latch onto an invisible ledge at the top of the room if you just have enough height. However, the glitch stops working in Chapter 17 if you use Amulet on the chain and reveal the grapple switch. So don't do that if you want to keep on testing.

Besides some stray level-specific magnetic ledges, in certain areas of the game Kratos can acquire a "persistent" ledge magnetism state during which almost all ledges become magnetic. This state is usually fixed by retrying and is very rare. The first instance where this happen is at the end of Chapter 24 when he returns to The Furnace. Another point of persistent ledge magnetism is in Chapter 26. This one is easier to access since it starts automatically if you just load a save into Chapter 26.

This glitch is still fairly mysterious, and it remains to be seen if even more uses are found for it in the future. If there was a way to get persistent ledge hyper-magnetism earlier than Chapter 25 and 26, it would probably be really useful in speedruns, making a number of high jumps obsolete.

## Lenient Air Momentum (LAM) (c: AKheon)

This is a classic glitch present in all main God of War-games in some form. If air attacks become interrupted in certain conditions, the attack's temporary gravity modifier lingers on Kratos for a small while, allowing his next jump to become more floaty. It's as if the air momentum became a bit more lenient for Kratos, and that's where the trick's name comes from.

You get LAM automatically if special moves become interrupted when hitting a rope or water. But this is usually not particularly useful. What you really need is ground-based LAM, and there are only very few ways to create it in God of War: Ascension. The most useful and universal way to get LAM is to jump a short time after landing from Poseidon Tremble (Air).

You get more LAM depending on your timing. If you did Poseidon Tremble (Air) from too high, Kratos gets a fairly average amount of LAM. If you did Poseidon Tremble (Air) from too low, that is to say from practically ground level, you don't get any LAM. Test for yourself and see what works. Also: you should be pushing L-stick to some direction during Poseidon Tremble to cut off a little of its cooldown and make the timing easier.

Another powerful but very situational way to get LAM is to attempt to do an air tether very close to ground level against enemies who are invalid targets, so that the air tether action just interrupts by itself. There's a list of all the enemies this works on in the section about break-outs.

A less useful way to get a lot of LAM is to do an aerial world weapon attack close to ground level, then break out of it with upgrading. There was more about the mechanism of upgrade break-outs in the section about Upgrade Jumps. At any rate, if you have an upgrade to spare, you'd probably rather want to use it on an actual Upgrade Jump rather than just getting some LAM.

Doing Zeus' Despair (air) right next to the ground level and jumping immediately afterwards also gives a tiny amount of LAM.

Doing Club air attack or Club discard at ground level and jumping immediately afterwards also gives you an incredibly tiny amount of LAM. Other world weapon attacks may give small amounts of LAM in these conditions s as well.

So, Kratos has some LAM. His first jump is now more floaty than before and he can do more attacks before falling down. A double jump makes existing LAM disappear, so this trick is only useful with any high or long jump tricks that can be done from ground jump, such as Broken Destiny jump or Shield Discard jump.

In God of War 1, LAM had odd side effects like allowing Kratos to breach water surface or elevator floors. It seems that LAM is the reason for the Poseidon Tremble speed glitch in this game. It remains to be seen if it might have other side effects too.

## Air Tether high jump (c: findlestick)

By launching enemies in air, then air tethering them repeatedly while doing Falling Helios in between, Kratos slowly gains height. Naturally, you can't do this trick with all enemies. The enemy has to be fairly small that you can launch in air and keep air grabbing without the fear of getting blocked. Smaller Satyrs or Manticore Hatchlings work well. It's actually the best to do this jump with flying enemies because a group of them tends to stay at Kratos' height, allowing him to repeat this jump longer and gain more height.

This trick is not very difficult to do and it can give impressive height, but it's very situational and currently not used in any speedrun category.

## Air Tether break-out high jump (c: findlestick)

Kratos has a glitchy reaction if he tries to air tether certain enemies that are not vulnerable to tethering. When this happens, Kratos breaks out of the tether, his air momentum is reset and he can also use his double jump in air afterwards.

As for why this glitch happens - certain targets are considered "invalid" by the game for a reason or another, perhaps because of a lack of a specific programmed tether reaction. If a tether connects with an invalid target, the game tries to use the target of Kratos' previous action (i.e. stale reference) as a target. If there is one, it will look like Kratos does an air tether to a wrong target. If there is none, then Kratos will break out of air-tether in the aforementioned way, resetting his air momentum and returning him back to a neutral state.

There's a list to all the enemies that are invalid targets later in the FAQ, in the section about break-outs.

## Glitched Olympic Strike (air) (c: AKheon)

Olympic Strike (air) i.e. Lightning L1+t is buggy. Trying to charge the attack in a certain way cancels it entirely after a certain point, returning Kratos to a neutral state in air.

This is the most easily accessible method of returning Kratos neutral during a high jump, but it can be tricky to utilize. Not only is the input for doing this glitch quite hard, but the attack itself is bad for Kratos' air momentum. All of this limits the circumstances where it can be used effectively, so it's generally only seen as a part of a Broken Destiny high jump that is done from first jump with LAM, i.e. a Combined Tactics jump.

To do the glitch, first get some height without wasting your double jump. Now you must attempt to do the charged version of Olympic Strike in air. So do the attack by pressing L1+t. Then let go of triangle and quickly press it again, holding it down. With correct timing, Kratos tries to do the charged version but it won't work, causing the attack to fizzle out, returning Kratos to neutral in air.

## Sling Discard jump (c: AKheon)

After you discard Sling in air, there's a very precise time when pressing circle makes Kratos buffer an unloaded Sling attack and he starts hovering in air in a neutral state.

This trick actually resets Kratos' ground jump for some reason, so you actually can do (at best) two jumps after having tossed away the Sling. But unfortunately, as usual, the ground jump is not very useful in air since it's subject to gravity and Kratos keeps falling during it, resulting in almost no air momentum benefit.

A ground-based Sling discard allows an esoteric, more powerful variation "Sling levitation", although it's very finicky and possibly frame-precise to pull off. To do this, discard Shield at ground level. The discard animation is so short that Kratos' current sub-weapon remains unloaded for a short while after he becomes free to move again. Buffering a new sub-weapon attack at this time causes Kratos to do a buggy unloaded attack, like in the air version. However, in rare cases, Kratos will not buffer an unloaded Sling attack but rather an unloaded Unarmed attack, which gives him a massive height boost, allowing him to instantly levitate for at least a large Broken Destiny jump's worth into air.

These Sling-related jumps might come in handy in a New Game run somewhere since they let you do better high jumps before getting the Amulet. Too bad they're fairly difficult or inconsistent to pull off, so it remains to be seen if anyone dares to use them in a speedrun.

## Javelin Discard jump (c: findlestick)

The animation of throwing your last Javelin has the same loophole as Sling Discard jump: with a precise timing, you are able to buffer an unloaded air attack to follow the discard, which returns Kratos to a neutral state in air.

With an even more precise timing, or just good luck, Kratos will instead buffer an unloaded Unarmed attack, which will lock Kratos' current momentum for a few seconds while giving him a bit of a boost. This allows you to slide diagonally upwards in air, making it possible to extend your current jump and gain a fair amount of height.

This can happen with Sword Discard too, with similar inputs, but it might be location-specific where it works.

I'll try writing more detailed instructions here once I've given this trick a try myself.

## Shield Run (c: AKheon)

Kratos runs a long way without needing any extra input from the player during the charged Shield attack. This can be used to multi-task during short in-game cutscenes during which Kratos would otherwise be forced to stand in place for a few seconds.

In rare cases being able to move during in-game cutscenes actually allows a skip or do. For instance, if an in-game cutscene first shows the surroundings for a few seconds before a fight begins and an obstacle appears to cover the exit, being able to run during those first few seconds may allow you to go past the obstacle before it even appears.

## Shield wall breaching (c: AKheon)

The first Shield attack has a strong forward momentum and Kratos sinks into walls during it somewhat easier than with any other known attacks. Therefore, if there is bad collision somewhere, Kratos can most likely slip through using a Shield attack. You can get behind some chests this way and also out of bounds at a few select places around the game.

## Poseidon Tremble speed glitch (c: Vipeazone)

If Kratos falls on sliding floor while doing Poseidon Tremble (air), something very strange happens. He gets extreme momentum for no apparent reason and flies off from the sliding surface uncontrollably. While in air, you can do attacks as usual to steer Kratos, but it is very difficult to give meaningful input to him since he has such a crazy speed.

Some precise data follows. Apparently Kratos' speed value becomes about 1800 during this glitch. For reference, Kratos' maximum falling speed is 50 and his default swim speed is 9, so you can imagine 1800 is helluva lot in comparison. Kratos apparently still keeps falling like normal although his horizontal speed is off the charts, but falling against walls can "convert" some of his horizontal momentum and help him stay in air. (thanks to Wulf2k9 for the technical explanation)

You can do massive shortcuts flying through the air almost instantly, but of course, using this trick is also risky and you will probably die a lot in the process. Using attacks like Broken Destiny or Sling shots slow down Kratos' flight a little, but still nowhere near enough to make his flying reasonable to control in real time.

The reason why this glitch happens appears to be LAM, i.e. Lenient Air Momentum. Perhaps the game attempts to convert Kratos' residual air momentum but something goes wrong with the math formula, resulting in a catastrophic increase in his velocity?

You can do a milder version of the glitch by creating circumstances where Kratos only has a small amount of LAM. For instance, if you do Poseidon Tremble at almost ground level, you get far less LAM than usual. Alternatively, you can do Poseidon Tremble on normal ground right before the sliding part, then quickly roll into the slide before all of Kratos' LAM has dissipated. These variations give you far more control over the glitch and make this trick more viable for speedrunning.

## Slide speed glitch (c: AKheon)

If you have a high horizontal velocity when you enter a slide, f.e. after doing a roll or do Hyperion Rush, Kratos flies through the air over the slide at a slightly elevated speed for a moment before landing. Doing attacks during this time works slightly differently from normal, and the slide sequence is unable to begin until Kratos' air attack is resolved and his residual air momentum also runs out.

It seems that being in the range of the slide converts Kratos' speed from his current attack into actual air velocity, which is quite uncommon and doesn't really happen anywhere else that I know of. At any rate, this means that doing high-speed attacks into the slide lets you start a slide sequence in air while also carrying some extraneous momentum the slide doesn't know how to handle.

Doing the first ground Shield attack into a slide gives Kratos the largest known speed boost. If you now quickly double jump and do a Shield air attack, you move at a high enough velocity that you can keep doing consecutive Shield attacks while hovering over the slide for a while, or simply go off-rails and go flying somewhere out of bounds at elevated speed.

This is a more controllable method of gaining speed during slide sequences than Poseidon Tremble speed glitch, and you only need the Shield to do it, so it should come in handy here and there.

Beware: holding block when trying to do this glitch will softlock Kratos because he will enter a state where he loses all his speed, cannot stop blocking but also cannot start sliding either.

## Multi-element Shield plume (a.k.a. Captain Planet glitch) (c: BigVEE)

The combo finisher Shield plume - circle, circle, triangle - is uniquely glitched. Although most world weapon attacks don't register element switching at all, this attack does not only register element switching every frame, but it also creates a new element finisher for each element you switch to. Therefore, rotating d-pad wildly during this attack can generate a dozen different element effects on the screen at once for massive damage, further cementing Shield as the best sub-weapon in the game. The effect is even greater if you have full Rage. This is one of the best ways to deal damage on NG-categories, and this ability could come in handy here and there on NG+ as well.

Worst part is that you need Shield to do this glitch. Besides that, the damage can be inconsistent since it depends on your d-pad rotation speed.

## Stale reference bugs

God of War: Ascension has a memory address that updates whenever Kratos grabs something or uses certain R1-prompts. Normally, it should be impossible to access this value before it gets updated again each time you grab an enemy, but grabs against certain "invalid" targets do not update the value and therefore Kratos will end up grabbing whatever is indicated by the old reference in memory.

Using this glitch, Kratos can try doing a grab to wrong enemies, dead enemies, cutscene props or even random R1-prompts like switches or chests. But if there is no previous target in memory, then Kratos simply breaks out of the grab and nothing too buggy happens.

The effects of this glitch vary depending on the target, of course. Targeting dead enemies with grabs can make the game mistakenly think they're alive again, making fights unwinnable. Targeting switches or chests causes a curious graphical effect but seemingly nothing else happens. Targeting movable objects like the coal pot at The Furnace forces them to "teleport" to a new location at the grab target, which can be a cool time saving trick when you just can't be bothered to push an object normally. This also allows you to get some of these objects in areas where you're never intended to take them normally.

Unfortunately, you can never move puzzle objects or enemies too far from their original location because of strict loading triggers. Once an enemy or object unloads, the reference is cleared in the memory and the attack just fizzles out instead. Any references in the memory are almost always cleared when you retry from a checkpoint too.

If Kratos is on top of the movable object that he moves with this bug, both he and the object gain a massive speed boost and fly off into lands unknown. The coal pot at The Furnace is the best object for testing this with.


### Some observations and limitations regarding stale reference bugs

- grapple point prompts can't be used as a stale reference.
- a world weapon prompt normally can't be used as a stale reference since it disappears when the weapon is picked up. However, the prompt can be accessed as a stale reference if you break out of the prompt in a way that it stays on the screen afterwards.
- dying enemies are usually unloaded from the memory pretty fast, so you have to be quick if you want to wrong target glitch a dying enemy.
- switching maps typically unloads the previous area and therefore clears the memory.
- retrying from last checkpoint almost always clears the memory.


There are two ways to do stale reference bugs in Ascension, and they are as follows...


### Ice Rage glitch (c: Robin Fleming, AKheon)

In brief: doing Ice Rage to any breakable object around the game causes a stale reference bug. This includes breakable urns, breakable walls, manticore eggs, bug nests, etc.

Frozen enemies also work for this purpose. Once an enemy is frozen, you have to do a special variant of Ice Rage to it. Jump in air and cast Ice Rage shortly before landing, so that Kratos does the air version of Ice Rage while touching ground - I tend to call this "landing Ice Rage".

Certain rare unfreezable targets like the first Hecatonchires boss in Chapter 1 can also give a stale reference bug. Grapple switches also work, although hitting them with Ice Rage can be tricky since Kratos does not automatically try targeting towards them.

Messing around with this glitch is the easiest on NG+, of course, since in those conditions you can give yourself infinite Rage and can activate Ice Rage more freely.

### Tether stale reference glitch (c: AKheon, findlestick)

This is a far less common way to do a stale reference gltch, and it's completely dependent on finding a right type of enemy that creates invalid tether reactions by default.

Doing tethers against wrong targets usually makes Kratos do a generic throwing animation against an invisible target while the target itself gets moved to Kratos' location, if possible. Sadly, no seriously interesting results have been discovered with a tether stale reference so far, even though it seems like a powerful glitch idea. But testing hasn't been entirely systematic as of yet.


#### List of enemies that create a tether stale reference

- Any frozen Bug enemy that is hit with ground tether.
- Any frozen Hound enemy that is hit with ground or air tether. This includes the parasite-infected Bug-Hounds in Chapter 3.
- Some variants of armored Satyrs that are hit with ground or air tether.
- Frozen Harpy that is hit with ground tether.
- Frozen Manticore Spawn that is hit with ground tether.
- Hecatonchire's tooth (Chapter 4) that is hit with air tether.
- Alecto (Chapter 30) that is hit with air tether. (?)


## Increase Ice Rage range (c: AKheon)

If you do some ranged attack, then interrupt the ranged attack with Ice Rage, the target that was used for the projectile is now instead used for Ice Rage, no matter how far it is, although walls will still block Ice Rage.

Javelins and Sling shots are the easiest to do this trick with. But it's also possible to do it after some weapon discards, like with Shield discard.

Sometimes the game makes Kratos target some odd environmental things after doing this glitch. For instance, in the later half of Chapter 3 Kratos is just as inclined to target the large elevator than he is to target the enemies. But any Ice Rages done against environmental things don't seem to cause any reactions.

## QTE zip glitch (c: AKheon)

Casting magic after events such as boss QTEs can make Kratos gain uncontrollable speed for a few frames. In a few cases this is enough to send him going through walls somewhere out of bounds.

It seems the reason why this glitch happens is related to the offset between the enemy's and Kratos' location. The game temporarily ties Kratos' location to the enemy's origin during important QTEs so that the QTE won't happen displaced. And it seems that casting magic quickly after the QTE makes Kratos become locked into the enemy again for a short time even though the QTE is already over.

You get different effects depending on the enemy's size and speed. This glitch has the biggest effect in the Hecatonchires boss fights in Chapter 1 and 3. Elsewhere in the game the effect is minor, with Kratos only sliding a few meters at best. You can barely even see the effect of the glitch unless you jump before casting the magic after the QTE - it seems being in air makes Kratos more responsive to the zip, somehow.

This glitch works with every magic, both air and ground version, with the exception of air Soul magic. For some reason, I've never gotten a zip to happen with that one.

Although you'd imagine you might get a similar effect with a number of other things which auto-position Kratos for a moment, so far, the only places I've seen zips happen are major QTE sequences vs large enemies or bosses.

Things that don't work for zipping:
- mini-games against smaller enemies. I guess in these cases the game positions the enemy to Kratos' position rather than the other way around.
- weapon pick-ups
- grapple points

## Break-outs

The term break-out means that Kratos breaks free of some dedicated action or even a cutscene. This kind of glitches are well sought after since you can usually do a lot of mayhem with them! There exist a few different ways to do break-outs in Ascension, so let's go over them...


### Upgrade break-outs (c: findlestick, AKheon)

The easiest way to do an Upgrade break-out is to use either an Amulet or Oath Stone attack, then go to the menu and upgrade whichever Item you were just using. The act of upgrading causes Kratos to instantly end the attack and enter t-pose for a brief moment. Simple as that - that was a break-out.

Upgrade break-outs are useful in high jumping because a break-out resets Kratos' air state, allowing you to use your double jump in air. This gives your jumps more versatility and potential height, although as a drawback you can only use these upgrade jumps on NG since everything is already maxed out on NG+.

Another, more obscure type of Upgrade Break-out was already talked about in the above section regarding Upgrade high jump and Sky Jump. In brief: upgrading your Blades and/or elements in certain combinations can cause Kratos to break out of his current world weapon attack and enter t-pose for a moment. A guaranteed way to do a world weapon break-out on your New Game save file is to not upgrade anything at all except Blades to Lv. 3. Then, once you get enough orbs for it, upgrading Blades to Lv. 4 causes a break-out to happen. This is the easiest setup if you want to try out what this trick feels like.

But if you had already upgraded something else, the above setup might not work. You could try figuring out if an upgrade is available by going through all the remaining Blades and Element levels to see if some upgrade (if any) will cause this esoteric glitch to happen. Findlestick has speculated that the order of your upgrades also might influence which combinations work and which don't.

So yeah, this is a fairly messy, enigmatic glitch... In a New Game speedrun, the runner might want to look into all this and figure out an "upgrading route" that allows him to gain relevant skills as well as break-out once or twice during the run for maximum benefit.

As mentioned, you can't do many Upgrade break-outs in a playthrough since there are only a finite amount of upgrades available to Kratos. You can only upgrade Amulet or Oath Stone once, and as for world weapon break-outs, it's unknown how many of those could be done in a single playthrough. Findlestick has suggested as many as three.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXiECGTc1FE


### Consecutive break-outs

One interesting thing about break-outs is that if you do a new action right at the moment of break-out, Kratos breaks out of that one too. So you can extend the breaking out effect from Shield attacks to pretty much any other attacks, or even dedicated animations like pulling switches or cutscenes with careful timing.

Instructions: for switches and other R1-prompts, have Kratos stand still next to them after a Shield attack so that his sub-weapon is still out. Then, start running, press start and R1 in that order in a very quick succession, then do the break-out by upgrading... if your timing was perfect, Kratos breaks out of the R1-prompt as well. For cutscenes, it's enough to f.e. Shield Jump into them and then break out at the correct frame.

Unfortunately, cutscene and prompt break-outs aren't that promising in this game because more often than not time is stopped during any prompt use sequence. So, even though Kratos breaks free, you still don't regain control and therefore don't benefit from it. Trying to break out of important story cutscenes like meeting Oracle can also lead to a crash, so that's also a drawback.


### Other notes and limitations regarding break-outs

Like in God of War II, breaking out in conjunction to using grapple points tends to crash the game.

It's not possible to break out of Amulet of Uroboros puzzle sequences by upgrading the Amulet while doing them.

You can break out of opening a chest and overlap Gorgon Eye or Phoenix Feather messages in the process. But this is not advantageous in any way - rather, you waste Eye / Feather chests and lose their contents if you open them up in too quick successions, or interrupt the message by examining other R1-prompts too soon.

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/wB4rWEn_Pyk?t=20


### Magic break-outs (c: AKheon)

Casting magic at a right time can cause a few different type of esoteric break-outs across the game. The first type of magic break-out that was discovered was tied to checkpoint retry. If you retry from last checkpoint and the checkpoint begins from a cinematic section, casting magic at a precise time may cause Kratos to break out and the cinematic scene to glitch up.

The effects vary depending on the cutscene as well as the type of magic you used. Ice Magic is the most consistent way to break Kratos out of events immediately. Soul and Fire Magic create a temporary break-out, but Kratos tends to resume the action he was supposed to do shortly after. Lightning either interrupts or has Soul / Fire-like effects in that Kratos will resume the event afterwards.

Another kind of magic break-out is related to one specific type of a prompt that can be used in both ground and in air but which is not a grapple point. Basically, just use the prompt at the same time as you cast magic. This kind of prompts are few and far between, though, and timing is practically frame-precise, so this variation is pretty hard to put into a good use.

A pretty good case example of the latter type of magic break-out is the pillar collapsing prompt near the end of Chapter 5. Casting magic at the correct time breaks Kratos free of the cutscene and lets him move early. Both ground and air magic work for this, and as mentioned, different magic types cause slightly different effects. For instance, ground Ice Magic causes the pillar to physically collapse as Kratos breaks out. Air Ice Magic and most of the other magics on the other hand cause the pillar to stay intact, and Kratos can later jump on top of an invisible collapsed pillar. This would actually be a time save if it wasn't so pointlessly precise to do!

The individual uses for this type of break-outs will be listed below in the level-specific glitches section. So far this trick has a lot of potential but only few actually good uses.

### Passive air tether break-outs (c: AKheon, Robin Fleming)

The "passive" air tether (i.e. using R1 in air without any targets nearby) will cause a break out once Kratos lands on ground. The most obvious use for this subtle exploit is to jump into story cutscenes while doing the passive air tether to break out of the cutscene automatically. This usually makes Kratos stand idly as the cutscene begins playing and time is stopped, which looks comical, but isn't necessarily very useful.

Landing during passive air tether also breaks Kratos out of any other ongoing air attacks, skipping their landing phase. There are only a few air attacks that can be done during a passive tether, though, most notably Unarmed air attack and the various air Rage-moves.

Sometimes it's possible to break out of R1 prompts as well using passive air Tether. It all depends on the prompt - if it's a non-grapple point prompt that can be activated in air, chances are that Kratos can break out of it by first doing air tether and then activating the prompt during the same jump. However, there needs to be floor under Kratos' feet since otherwise Kratos does not land during the passive air tether and the break-out cannot happen.

To note, there is also a ground version of passive tether which is done if Kratos tries to pick up a world weapon right outside its range with no other targets nearby, but so far it's less useful for doing glitches.

Doing a Soul or Fire Rage or a weapon discard into a trigger frame precisely can also rarely cause a break-out, but it varies a lot where this works. Air tether is the easier, all around more reliable option to use.

The known break-outs are listed below in the level-specifics section, so look there for more info.

### Climbing wall leap break-out (c: AKheon)

A.k.a. Rage break-out.

Normally when Kratos leaps off a ledge towards another ledge during a dedicated climbing section, you can't control the leap in any way or do attacks in air. However, using a Rage at this moment breaks Kratos out of the leap animation and lets him regain control. You will have a fairly good horizontal momentum because of the leap, allowing you to do some small skips around the game.

Using Fire Rage for the break-out is recommended because it's the Rage with the shortest animation and it's also easiest to combo with other aerial attacks. Also, as you may have guessed, this trick is mostly reserved for NG+ since Rage is a finite resource on NG.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2GCHj_0B70


### Grapple switch break-out (c: AKheon)

You know the grapple switches around the game you have to latch onto and pull? You can actually break out of them by doing any Rage attack. This makes Kratos enter a kind of a combined state between his normal moveset and being latched onto the grapple switch, which causes some graphical glitches since his chains are still wonkily attached to the grapple point. You can do normal attacks to any direction you want, but the glitch has a tendency to end by itself at the end of certain attacks, if you try running or rolling at certain times, etc. It also seems you cannot take the glitch too far away from the original grapple point since Kratos will automatically detach from it.

It's not possible to normally jump in the combined mode since this ends the break-out. However, you can still get into air with Apollo's Ascension or even regular ascensions since the game thinks Kratos' regular attacks are causing "hits" as long as he is attacking near the grapple switch. If you sprint and then jump, you get a glitched jump where Kratos stays in the sprinting animation in air. After landing he may also enter a strange falling / idle animation for a few seconds, probably because there's no specific landing animation for when you're using a grapple switch. What's also curious about the sprinting jump is that it lets you move Kratos far away from the grapple switch without it following you, which increases your capacity to reach more prompts and events while using a grapple switch.

It's difficult to activate any prompts or target enemies with tether while in this mode, since all of Kratos' auto-targeting always aims towards the grapple switch he is currently holding onto.

After getting Amulet, you can create a different variation of the grapple switch break-out by simply pressing L2 at some point during the break-out. This allows Kratos to run freely while still holding onto the grapple switch - however, the switch doesn't follow you at all in this mode. Doing an attack or a roll uses the grapple switch moveset, after which Kratos can resume running free. You can jump in air but can't do any other attacks in air than the basic Unarmed attack, for some reason. In any case, in this mode you can move Kratos far away from the grapple switch even easier than before or even leave a shadow clone holding the grapple switch somewhere pointlessly far away. Just to note, usually doing this causes some additional glitches at grapple switch puzzles, but specific examples will be listed later on in the level-specific glitches.

If you use Oath Stone (after acquiring it) during a grapple switch break-out, you'll find out that it has a very high priority and can cancel essentially any other ground action that Kratos is able to perform, including magics. This can cause some minor glitchy effects, like magic special effects looking a bit odd if you interrupt a magic mid-way through. Interrupting weapon discard actions is possible, although so far this hasn't caused anything special to happen. Interrupting a weapon pick-up doesn't seem to be possible, as Kratos cannot use the prompt while using a grapple switch. Even though Oath Stone is a ground-only action, you can also interrupt certain air actions with it, as long as you can do them touching ground.

Grapple points aren't too common around the game, and each grapple point also has a natural limit to how far Kratos can move before he automatically latches off, so there are limits to what you can do with grapple switch break-outs. The glitch is also easiest to do on NG+, since you can only get infinite Rage in that mode.

Theoretically speaking, it might cause something interesting to happen if you could escape the range of a grapple switch so that the grapple switch data and move set would unload, but so far there is no practical way to do this anywhere in the game. Although Kratos only latches off the grapple switch automatically when he is grounded, it's difficult to move in air during a grapple switch break-out since you cannot jump.

### Sheathe break-outs (c: AKheon)

Whenever Kratos has finished using a sub-weapon, there is a short sheathe animation where he puts the weapon back in his pocket. This action will overlap with many other of Kratos' moves, subtly changing their properties. Most importantly, you are able to activate prompts during attacks - which is normally never possible - while Kratos is sheathing.

The sheathe animation will stop instantly and does not become overlapped with blocking - and therefore it cannot be carried over into special moves. Using Amulet or Magics also ends the sheathe immediately. Finally, a new sub-weapon attack also seems to cancel the sheathe and thus cannot be overlapped with prompt usage.

Using most prompts during most attacks seems to work in a surprisingly normal fashion. However, there exists at least one input sequence which causes a break-out from most generic prompts, and that is to overlap sprint with a prompt, then press R1 followed by X right after Kratos begins using the prompt.

The difficulty of this trick varies depending on the sub-weapon. Unarmed and Sling do not have a sheathe animation, so a sheathe break-out is not possible with them. Shield seems to have the longest sheathe and it's also fairly easy to access due to the weapon's agile moveset, so that makes it one of the best contenders for doing this glitch with.

### Amulet break-outs (c: AKheon)

If you aim using the Amulet and let go, Kratos enters a vaguely buggy state where he cannot move for half a second. Many of his attacks and even prompt usage can become buffered in this state. For some reason, it seems that a buffered attack and prompt become very briefly overlapped like this.

Much like with the sheathe break-outs, a generic prompt break-out can be done by overlapping sprint and a generic prompt, then jumping at a precise time. In other words, the complete input sequence for this break-out is: L2 (once you have Amulet), let go, L3 to sprint, quickly R1 followed by X right as Kratos starts using the prompt.

As for the limitations of this trick, it's only possible to do after you acquire Amulet. And so far it doesn't seem to do anything that isn't already possible to accomplish using the sheathe break-out.

# Weapon and move info

## General moves

The developers did a major reworking on the jumping and air mechanics in Ascension. Most noticeable differences are...

- Kratos is unable to rise up in air using a regular ascension unless it hits a target. This makes performing a classic high jump (like in the original God of War) much more situational and hard.
- most ground actions that previously cut off when going over a ledge no longer do that. Instead, Kratos will fall down while performing the ground action.
- it's easier to steer Kratos after having jumped. It's even possible to hold block in air and steer.


## Blades of Chaos

Kratos has a new Blades skill in this title, and that is to sprint a short distance by pressing L3. For some reason this move can be buffered after almost every attack. It combos better than your normal attacks do! Unlike most moves in the game, it interrupts when running off a ledge. Kratos also has a bit of regular velocity during it, as if he was normally running. The sprint can help with agile navigation through the game, so don't overlook it.


The Hyperion Ram gives Kratos such a high speed that it makes it slightly easier for him to slip through tight cracks in collision. It's unknown if this attack is worse or equal to the first Shield attack in this regard.

The Hyperion Ram can react glitchily when done against damaging collision, making Kratos temporarily invulnerable to it. One place where to test this is the spiked switch in Chapter 28.



### Vanishing Blades bug

Rarely Kratos' Blades may disappear entirely. He can still do basic combos, but there are no Blades that would contact with enemies and damage them. Sub-weapons still seem to work like normal, though, even though they look invisible.

This is a fairly mysterious glitch as of now, with only a few reports of it ever happening. Findlestick managed to capture some footage of it, and as forvhow it started, he mentioned that he upgraded the Blades around the same time Kratos was blinded by the Bug enemies twice repeatedly, then he got hit by a Cyclops too.

### Tether observations

There are two versions of air Tether: the normal version where Kratos targets and hits a foe to grab them, and also a "passive tether" which Kratos does if he is neutral in air and there are no targets nearby. Passive tether lasts about a second, and it can become overlapped with other air actions, although it should be noted that not many air actions are enabled during a passive tether - mainly the Unarmed air attack and various Rage-actions. Kratos breaks out of anything when he lands on ground while doing passive tether. There was more about this glitch ("tether break-out") in the techniques-section above.

Kratos can do a passive tether on ground level too if you are just barely too far away from certain R1 prompts, like World Weapons. Like with the air version of passive tether, most ground actions are disabled during it - you can only jump or use Unarmed attacks or Rage, basically. Air sheathe (after landing) can influence ground passive tether slightly, making Kratos' arm slightly displaced.

Opening a chest while ground passive tether is active causes the "fast chest opening" glitch to occur, which is a very minor form of break-out. It remains to be seen if other break-outs could also happen thanks to ground passive tether.

If you're slightly outside a grabbable enemy's range and try to do air tether, Kratos will instead do a passive air tether. If you then do air Ice Rage, Kratos will instead do a regular air tether instead of Ice Rage, or at least something that looks like it. This can happen with other Rage-attacks too, but Ice Rage is the easiest one.


### Element observations

The different elements don't impact Kratos' basic attacks too much. You mainly just get different special effects for each swipe as well as different combo finishers - one for the fourth square hit (s4) and one for the sixth (s6).

If you do Soul or Ice s4 finisher down a ledge, Kratos will do the classic s4 while falling down. Wonder why?

If you upgrade Blades at a precise timing while doing s4 finisher, you can get the element power effect (like Souls flying out) even without hitting anything. Somehow upgrading fools the game into thinking that your attack hit something!


### Tether oddity

Tethering enemies near walls can sometimes give a big height boost for Kratos, but it only lasts for a moment. Kratos also gets to use his double jump in air after some variants of air tether. There was more about this above in the section about tether high jumps.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYTq8zFSUM#t=142


## Elemental powers

### So what do elemental powers do in practice?

- They give Blades combo finishers an elemental effect. The effect becomes more powerful if Rage is full.
- Enemies killed by the elemental effects drop colored orbs - the color varies by the element.
- Certain attacks of the basic combos change with different weapons. For example the Rage-less fourth attack in a combo.
- Every element has unique special moves, Rage special and magic.


Generally speaking, most elemental specials aren't very good in this game. The main reason for this is that their damage does not scale up as you upgrade your Blades. In other words, by the end of the game your regular Lv. 5 Blade-combos will have a high damage multiplier, but the elemental attacks are still at the same power as they were upon acquiring them.


### Wrong element attacks?

There are a few ways to do elemental special attacks using the wrong element. This is mostly just a graphical effect - Kratos either does the special with wrong element graphics or two element graphics may combine, it depends a little on the attack.


#### How to do wrong element attacks

- One fairly simple method for doing wrong element specials on ground level is to hold L1, then press d-pad to switch elements roughly at the same time as you press square or triangle. You can also do wrong element Magics this way, but Rages are too hard to time.

- You can do a wrong element s4 or s6 quite easily by switching elements after buffering that attack.

- You can do wrong element Rages easily after t3. Buffer a Rage during the attack, then switch elements to get a wrong element Rage.

- One of the easiest methods to do wrong element attacks is by using world weapons. Do an attack with a world weapon so that Kratos remains standing with the world weapon in hand. Now you can change element so that it becomes buffered in the background, only changing once you leave the world weapon's idle animation. Once you've done this, you can just start running while instantly casting a wrong element Rage, etc.

- You can do a wrong element Rage by buffering a Rage after a roll, then switching elements.

- Another way to do a wrong element Rage is to buffer Rage during the little transitional animation after s2 or s5 and then switch elements. This is pretty hard to do and requires sharp timing.

- Yet another way to do a wrong element Rage is to buffer Rage after being in item aiming stance, then switch elements.

- In air, options for doing wrong element attacks are very limited if not non-existent. You can do a wrong element Lightning Rage by buffering a Rage after air Lightning L1+t (Olympus Strike) and switching element. And you can do a wrong element Ice Rage by buffering a Rage after air L1+s (Broken Destiny) and switching element. That's about it for now...


Wrong element Rage-attacks actually have glitchy results that go beyond the cosmetic. Here's a short list:

- If you do a wrong element Fire Rage, it does chip damage as usual but doesn't plant a fire bomb into the enemy.

- If you do a wrong element Ice Rage, the attack totally glitches up and becomes useless. It looks like Kratos just throws his chains ineffectually at the enemies. Alternatively, the normal Ice Rage may happen with wrong colors.

- If you do a wrong element Lightning Rage, it's just the normal Rage except with wrong element shining on Kratos' Blades.

- If you do a wrong element Soul Rage, Kratos does the attack but no souls come out.


Finally, it's possible to do wrong element magics as well. But again, they don't seem to be anything too special, basically just a little graphical quirk.


### A. Fire of Ares

Fire-element is one of the best elements for stunning enemies and generating rage. Finishing enemies off with fire attacks yields yellow orbs.


Fire Rage leaves a bomb inside a target that detonates within a few seconds. The bomb's timer is influenced by some internal value that tracks a target's speed. For instance, the bomb timer does not run at all when an enemy is frozen.

Normally Fire Rage is deflected off certain targets, f.e. Megaera that is shielded by Tisiphone in their fight in Chapter 20. However, you can bypass this limitation by casting an aerial Fire Rage so low that Kratos touches ground during it.

Both the swing and the bomb of Fire Rage have the power to disarm Shielded enemies. Fire Rage can also create an unique stunned mode with most larger enemies if you cast it twice in a row.

You can target some non-enemy things with Fire Rage and inject a fire bomb into 
them, which looks strange.
 

You can do non-Rage versions of Cyclone of Fire and Inferno Slam even with full Rage by using a certain button combination. Have some other element than Fire active, then quickly press L1, then switch to Fire and press square or triangle almost at the same time. With exact timing you'll do a wrong element special attack (as mentioned above), but with a very very slightly delayed timing you will do a non-Rage version even if you have full Rage.


Inferno Slam (air) eventually kills Kratos if it can't resolve naturally. For example, if you do this move in too cramped spaces where he can't land, eventually Kratos starts his "flailing wildly" animation and upon touching ground dies instantly.


The Fire Magic consists of two strong hits, the second of which only happens if you win a short QTE. It's the most powerful magic damage-wise and also affects enemies in a wide range, so it's a good basic magic to use in most situations.

The apparent slowdown during a magic casting only slows down enemies but not the game world itself. This means you can cast magic during autoscroller sections without it necessarily wasting any real time. This is true for all the magics except for the Fire Magic because the short QTE prompt does slow down the game world as well.

If you go to the menus during the Fire Magic, all the sounds will be muffled. This is also true for all the magics.

If you do Fire Magic into a cutscene, you can buffer a tether (or R1 activation) to happen after it. This is also true for other magics as well.


### B. Ice of Poseidon

Finishing enemies off with ice attacks yields red orbs.


Broken Destiny is quite good at disarming enemies. Rarely it can even disarm Shielded enemies.


Broken Destiny (air) has almost non-existent air momentum loss, and is thus an ingredient in a variety of high jumps. There was more about this in the techniques section above.


Poseidon Tremble that's powered up with Rage was probably intended to create a double ice-shockwave, but due to a bug, the second shockwave does not appear unless you switch elements during the move. It seems Poseidon Tremble (air) cannot shoot out double shockwaves no matter the circumstance.


Poseidon Tremble (air) has several odd things about it, although most of them have already been elaborated in the techniques section above. See the sections about Lenient Air Momentum (LAM), Poseidon Tremble ledge magnetism, Poseidon Tremble super speed glitch and high jumps for more info... yeah, it's quite a broken move.

Poseidon Tremble (air) is possibly the only move in Kratos' arsenal that lasts endlessly if you do it over a pit. All the other downsmash attacks resolve or cut short in some way, but Poseidon Tremble (air) just keeps on going until you hit some death floor or break out of it with Ice Rage. Furthermore, normally Kratos gets killed by some invisible timer if he falls too long, but this doesn't happen with Poseidon's Tremble (air), so that's one way to fall endlessly under the map.

If he has forward momentum, Kratos can also climb up some sloped floor using Poseidon Tremble (air), but this is quite rare to see in practice.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of climbing up a slope with Poseidon Tremble (Air):
        https://youtu.be/HxMGUpxNZi4?t=71


Ice Rage is another move that ranks among the most buggy ones in the entire game. A lot of its oddities have been already listed above, mainly in the section about stale reference bugs.

Although it's very counter-intuitive, the first thing Ice Rage does is reset the enemy's state of frozenness. In other words, doing Ice Rage on larger enemies after casting Ice Magic to them will make them less frozen.

You can increase the range of Ice Rage greatly by tossing a Javelin or a Sling shot before using Ice Rage. This was also mentioned in the techniques section above.

If Kratos does Ice Rage to enemies while standing on higher floor, the enemies are dragged up to Kratos' level momentarily, forcing them to stand in air. Kratos himself is always forced on ground level when doing Ice Rage.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid of an enemy rising in air during Ice Rage:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD8k-gOFuxY#t=14


Ice Magic freezes all enemies in the vicinity. If the enemies are armed with Shields, they will also drop them.

Some important enemies that have to be killed with a cinematic finisher can't be frozen and shattered - they just become frost-coated and slow down a bit. Some bosses don't visually look like they become frosted but they may still get slowed down a little bit by this magic.

If Ice Magic hits any enemies that are already frozen, it will restart the freeze timer.

Ice Magic (air) makes Kratos rapidly fall down, and during the attack he can sink into certain types of objects in the levels. Kratos only becomes ejected out of them after the magic animation is over.

The Ice Magic can create glitchy hits if it contacts breakable objects.


### C. Lightning of Zeus

This element specializes in generating a lot of hits, although sadly this by itself isn't a very useful property. Finishing enemies off with electric attacks yields blue orbs.


The special moves and magic do not damage destructible objects for some reason. ยง


Zeus' Despair that's powered up with Rage was probably intended to create a double projectile, but due to a bug, the second projectile does not appear unless you switch elements during the move. This works with both ground and air versions of the move.

Zeus' Despair can disarm Shields from enemies, but it's not 100% consistent.

The Zeus' Despair projectiles slow down in the range of Amulet time-slow effect. ยง


Olympus Strike when charged can disarm Shielded enemies.

Olympus Strike (air) at full rage bar has a glitch in it: if you try to do the charged version of the attack in air by letting go and then holding down triangle after the move has started, the move will fizzle out and interrupts instantly. There was more about this in the high jumps section above.

Olympus Strike (air) is one of the better attacks for doing long jumps with since it barely hinders Kratos' horizontal speed while allowing him to fall down slightly slower.

If you interrupt the ground version of rage Olympus Strike with Lightning Rage while you're charging it, the Rage glitches up and you can no longer steer during it. This seems to be an oddity that's unique to this specific combination of moves: wrong element Olympus Strike interrupted with other element Rage, or vice-versa, doesn't seem to cause additional glitchy effects.

The ground version of Olympus Strike automatically interrupts with a break-out if you are doing it and time stops (f.e. inside a cutscene).


There are some attacks which knock Kratos out of Lightning Rage although he should be invulnerable during it. A lot of Manticore's attacks are like this, for instance. ยง


Lightning Magic can sometimes get stuck in the animation if you're in an area that has a rising floor beneath Kratos. Kratos emits lightning bolts for pretty much forever and you can't control him any longer.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVvLGGDJkkE


If you cast Lightning Magic in combination with using grapple points, Kratos can steer his momentum to new directions. Should be tested more. ยง

### D. Soul of Hades

Finishing enemies off with soul attacks yields green orbs.


Tormenting Sorrow sends out shockwaves. If Rage is full, the second shockwave will stun even strong enemies quite effectively.


Underworld Agony creates a Hades' arm that spawns at ground level at enemy location. This is a rare instance of homing damage in this game, much like Soul Rage. The Hades' arm is a damaging region that exists for a few seconds and causes a variable number of hits. Having Rage full creates a more powerful region that can hit more times. This attack can also disarm Shielded enemies.


Only a limited amount of souls can be released during Soul Rage. If Kratos tries to do the Rage many times in a row, no new souls come out.

Unfortunately the game makes any summoned souls disappear at the start of most cutscenes when time becomes stopped, so that limits the things you can do with them.


Soul Magic can disarm Shielded enemies.


### E. About Rage

At the start of the game Kratos does non-elemental Rage attacks. Later on this 
option is no longer available, because as soon as Kratos picks up the Fire of 
Ares he is always forced to keep one element active no matter what.


If you buffer a Rage before running out of Rage, Kratos still executes the Rage 
attack.


## Items

### F. Amulet of Uroborus:

Taking out the Amulet with L2 is a very high priority move and it interrupts many attacks that otherwise can't be interrupted. Even some air specials. This makes the Amulet handy for certain types of high jumps - there was more about this in the techniques section.


Upgrading Amulet while Kratos is using it causes a full break out and he enters t-pose momentarily. Having broken out, he can use his second jump in air, helping some high jump variations. There is more about this above.


Sometimes the Amulet HUD disappears completely and you won't see the texts "Decay" or "Heal" on the screen when doing Amulet events.


The green Amulet screen effect is known to become stuck when retrying from checkpoints associated by solving some Amulet event.


Kratos enters a vaguely glitchy mode when you let go of Amulet aim on ground. For a few moments he cannot move but you can buffer attacks and even prompts. This lets you overlap actions with prompts, allowing a specific type of a break-out. There was more about it in the techniques-section.


### G. The Oath Stone of Orkos

Upgrading Oath Stone while Kratos is using it also causes a full break-out, forcing Kratos into t-pose momentarily.

Attacks of the shadow Kratos cause enemies to drop their Shields instantly, which can be useful to know.

Sometimes shadow Kratos glitches up and just stands still instead of attacking the enemies. This seems to happen if shadow Kratos tries to hit an enemy but the target becomes unavailable or missed for some reason. If this happens, shadow Kratos will continue hanging out nearby instead of vanishing. He has collision and can be hit, causing blood to fly out, but he can't be targeted by any means like tethering or Ice Rage. He disappears if you use the Oath Stone a second time.

The grapple switch version of using Oath Stone can be used without any cooldown. After all, its only purpose is to be used in puzzles. If you use grapple switch break-out to combine normal grounded state and a grapple switch, this input has such a high priority that it can cancel a surprising amount of ground actions, even magic or weapon discard attacks.


### H. Eyes of Truth

You get the Eyes of Truth really late in the game. So late that you only get to use it for a few puzzles, a fight or two and... that's it. It can't be upgraded either.


## World weapons

World weapons are a new mechanic in God of War: Ascension. Kratos can find weapon pick-ups around the levels, or he may also pick up weapons from enemies he disarms. These weapons are interchangeable and can't be upgraded in any way, and once you're done with a world weapon, you can discard it as an extra powerful finishing move.


#### Some notes follow

- If Kratos has no world weapon, he uses an Unarmed move set instead.

- Most world weapon attacks do not accumulate Rage.

- Holding the circle button down usually results in "charged" versions of world weapon attacks.

- Most world weapons have a power attack that you see if you combo into world weapon from a longer Blades combo. But other than that, world weapons don't have many interesting combo options with Blades.

- You can buffer an unique sub-weapon attack from a roll.

- There are no element switch checks during almost any world weapon animations. This means that Kratos won't switch Blade element while he has a world weapon out - you won't even see a change buffered until all world weapon animations are over.

- You can do wrong element special attacks with the help of any world weapon. There was more about this above.

- The R1-prompt for picking up a world weapon still exists for a frame or two after the pick-up animation is over. With some luck, you can activate it to get one of two effects: either Kratos picks up the weapon again, or sometimes he enters a vaguely glitchy frozen animation where he tries to pick up the weapon, but this only lasts for a moment before it ends by itself. So far, neither of these minor bugs is useful.

- Kratos will automatically break out of picking up a world weapon if he falls down during the pick-up animation. This is rarely possible to do if there's a pickable weapon near a ledge or unsteady floor, like the Club at the end of Chapter 17.

- If you discard a world weapon in areas where the game is actively streaming level data, the game cannot load back the Unarmed move set for Kratos as quickly as usual. This leaves the sub-weapon indicator in the HUD blank indefinitely, and during this time pressing circle to do attacks does nothing.

- With a precise timing, you can overlap the sub-weapon sheathe animation as you do other actions. This causes the action to look slightly weird, f.e. Kratos' chains may look oddly sticky. This is mostly a cosmetic effect, although it can do things like impact the range of attacks. Different sub-weapons can cause slightly different looking effects, so feel free to experiment. The sheathe animation can also be used to do a type of a break-out, but there was more about this above in the sheathe break-out section.


### A. Unarmed

Spartan Kick has a chance to disarm enemies. However, it cannot disarm Shields except in one, somewhat buggy circumstance, which is if you kick a Shield Satyr right after it un-freezes and get lucky.

The basic Unarmed air attack is quite good for high jumping since it reacts to Kratos' existing velocity and does a big arc in air. Just make sure to get yourself good momentum by doing the attack as soon as possible after your second jump and watch Kratos go.

The basic Unarmed air attack reacts strangely when hitting water. Kratos becomes somewhat floaty and can sometimes keep doing continuous Unarmed jumps above water.

If you press R1 to do a passive tether shortly before Unarmed air attack, the attack will interrupt instantly upon landing. Might be useful to know when doing some tricky platforming that the long cooldown of the Unarmed attack could ruin.

If you do the L1+O attack from an outrageously high altitude, Kratos enters a somewhat silly looking "free fall" animation at its end. Unlike in some previous games in the series, this is not fatal, and Kratos can still recover if he lands on solid ground within some seconds.

Hyperion Uppercut is a somewhat useful move. Its specialty is disarming enemies. If the attack makes contact, the enemy's weapon falls off and lands on ground nearby where Kratos can pick it up.


### B. Sword

The most common weapon found around the game, Sword is a fast melee weapon that combos well with Blades of Chaos.

Each time Kratos makes a hit with a Sword he gains some extra orbs. So for early orb gathering, Sword is the recommended weapon. In certain places the Sword can also be used for grinding infinite red orbs - although it's slow.

If a charged Sword attack hits something, holding down circle will make Kratos continue doing a high-speed slashing combo against the target.

Kratos' hitbox extends through the floor during the charged Sword air attack. If there is death collision right under the floor, he may accidentally hit it while doing the attack, giving the impression of sinking into the floor and dying.

After doing Sword air attacks, during the cooldown you can often see some residual glitch Sword graphics somewhere in the vicinity. Especially noticeable if Kratos has full Rage, as the Sword will be glowing. Interrupting ground Sword attacks with Amulet aim will also make a glitchy sword graphics float in air.


### C. Club

The second most common weapon found around the game. Club is very slow and clumsy but semi-powerful. Use at your own risk.

Club attacks are quite potent at disarming enemies. They can also cause some unique stun or launch reactions that are not possible with any other world weapon or ability.

If you do the charged Club attack into some cutscene or event where time becomes stopped, Kratos remains in the charge animation indefinitely even if you stop holding buttons. However, you can't move during this time.


### D. Javelin

A projectile weapon. Comes in limited number.

The Javelin discard looks similar but is mechanically different from the attack Kratos does automatically when throwing away his last Javelin.

If you interrupt air Javelin discard with a grapple point a second into it, the slow-down of the attack carries over to using the grapple point for a moment in a slightly unusual way.

If you do an Ice Rage after tossing a Javelin, the range of Ice Rage greatly increases.


### E. Sling

A projectile weapon. Comes in limited number.

Sling's air attacks are somewhat useful for long jumping since Kratos moves forward during them. I guess the biggest issue is that Sling is a rare weapon that you usually don't have on Kratos... and also, Shield is still generally much better for high or long jump purposes.

Running out of slingshots, Kratos automatically does what looks like a basic discard attack. However, this attack is slightly different properties-wise. It doesn't have any slowdown or create fireworks for example.

Kratos' air momentum resets when doing Sling air discard. This could be useful to know for certain high jumps.

If you do an Ice Rage after tossing a Sling shot, the range of Ice Rage greatly 
increases.

Unlike any other world weapon except Unarmed, Sling has no sheathing animation after its attacks.


### F. Shield

The regular Shield attack lets Kratos move for a moment at a very fast speed. He sinks a little inside nearby collision during this move and if there are any noticeable gaps in the collision, he has a good chance to slip through.

Shield can be used to do a number of glitchy tactics in the game, including Shield Jump, Shield Run, Sky Jump and Captain Planet-glitch. There was more about these tricks in the above sections.

Both of your jumps are replenished after doing Shield air attack, so if there was some weird way to perform this attack without losing all that height, it would be one way of infinite jumping.

Shield air attack doesn't cancel like normal attacks when hitting water surface. Instead the attack breaks off a feet above water surface, leaving Kratos hovering in air for a moment. Kratos can start doing continuous Shield Jump over water surface if he wants to.

Kratos' hitbox extends through the floor during a Shield air attack. If there is death collision right under the floor, he may accidentally hit it while doing the attack, giving the impression of sinking into the floor and dying.



# Other general glitches and observations
 
## Enemy-specific notes

There's no combat arena in Ascension, so I'm not 100% sure on the official enemy names.


### In general

Kratos can sometimes break out of enemy grab animations. Height differences can do that, as some other mystery factors as well. I've seen this happen with Satyr Generals and Gorgons, at least.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYTq8zFSUM#t=44


### Parasite

I.e. the small bug-like enemies you see around the game.

There is an unique variant of Parasite for each element. They're quite similar to one another, with the main difference being the type of explosion they create upon being thrown.

It's possible to do a stale reference bug with this enemy by trying to a ground tether to it when it's frozen.


### Hound

There are at least two variants of Hound-enemies, one regular and one that is infected by Megaera's parasites. However, behaviorally and mechanically they seem to be quite similar.

It's possible to do a stale reference bug with this enemy by trying to do a ground or air tether to it when it's frozen.


### Infected Human

Mechanically they're quite similar to the small Satyrs, as they can appear wielding swords and can be grabbed with tether for various mini-game options.


### Harpy

It's possible to do a stale reference bug with this enemy by trying to do a ground tether to it when it's frozen. Of course, getting the enemy to land safely on ground while frozen can be a bit tricky...

Soul Rage sometimes causes flying enemies like the Harpies to float really high up in air as they are stunlocked by souls. This can be troublesome since the enemies can end up in a place where they can't fly back down from, causing the fight to become stuck.


### Cyclops

The Cyclops in Chapter 3 is unique and cannot be damage killed in any way. It also immediately unthaws if frozen. This is because the game expects you to mini-game the Cyclops in order to progress in the game.

The Cyclops enemies have a strange "rope" object beneath them that you can see 
if you go out of bounds or sometimes when knocking down the Cyclops. Wonder 
what's up with that? It can be seen in Kirra re-visit and The Furnace at least.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's video of Kirra re-visit:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L45RlpXX5QA


### Satyr

Satyrs can appear in many different types. They can wield all the five different world weapons. Some of them are armored.

One particular type of armored Satyr can be used to do a stale reference bug.

Unarmed Satyrs can pick up a number of other weapons but not Shields. Sometimes when a Satyr attempts to rush towards a weapon to pick it up, they miss and instead start endlessly running against nearby walls. They will continue as long as the weapon exists in the level.

GMG has mentioned that disarmed Javelin Satyrs, if placed in an area where they can't reach their weapon again, stop fighting altogether. ยง

If you do the "X" grapple finisher to an enemy that is on higher ground or behind a wall, so that Kratos' dash never contacts with it, the enemy will glitch up. They will hold their chest in pain as if they were still being grappled by Kratos even though the grapple is over. You can disable whole groups of enemies by doing this to all of them.

In unknown circumstances, Satyrs can stay lying down if Kratos throws them away after a grapple. They may suddenly recover once Kratos comes close enough again, though.

Satyrs can also get stuck in the "wrestling with Kratos" animation in unknown circumstances.

### Satyr (Shield)

Shielded Satyrs are quite an unique menace in this game. While carrying a Shield, these enemies generally cannot take damage from any source. Furthermore, they can also parry Kratos and do an unique counter if you try to do a direct assault.

Certain attacks like Poseidon Tremble or Lightning Rage knock away and appear to hurt Shielded Satyrs, but they don't take any damage from it.

If you do an air tether to a Satyr carrying a Shield, the camera will zoom in on Kratos for a moment as the air tether is deflected, as if the special mini-game was about to start but was cancelled.

Disarming with grapple makes some Shield Satyrs, like the first one encountered in Chapter 7, start wielding an invisible sword that cannot hit Kratos. In other words, they become completely harmless. Tethering and knocking them away may then make their A.I. become completely passive as well. It seems you can't disarm a Shield Satyr wielding an invisible sword, which is a pity - would've been interesting to be able to wield this glitchy non-existent weapon.

Grappling Shields off enemies does not work in some areas for a reason or another. ยง


#### Frozen Shield Satyr glitches:

If you freeze a Shield Satyr using Ice Rage, he will get frozen while still carrying his Shield. Quite uniquely, the frozen statue appears to be immune to all damage! (c: GMG)

Shortly after thawing, the Shield Satyr has the hit reactions of a mostly normal Satyr, which allows you to f.e. launch him in air while he still has his Shield. This is a somewhat unusual state of affairs, since it's not easy to launch a Shield Satyr in normal circumstances. Trying to do a ground tether on an airborne Shield Satyr will cause the normal Shield disarming mini-game to begin with slightly displaced graphics.

While you normally can't disarm a Shield Satyr's Shield with a kick, this becomes possible if you kick them while they're thawing. The disarming animation looks a bit buggy, as if it was supposed to impact the Sword in their hands instead of the Shield.

You can also hit a frozen Shield Satyr with Fire Rage to plant a bomb inside him without him getting disarmed. The bomb going off will disarm the Satyr, unless he has also been launched in air.

There's a good chance Ice Rage was originally supposed to disarm the Shield Satyr before freezing him. However, in practice this move first freezes before disarming, so it ends up never disarming the Satyr since frozen targets cannot be disarmed. To note, Ice Rage will disarm Shield Satyrs if done in circumstances where the Satyr does not end up frozen, f.e. through a stale reference.

### Juggernaut

If a Juggernaut manages to grab Kratos through a wall, the grab glitches up and 
becomes inescapable. Juggernaut will hold an absent Kratos in his hand and 
blood squirts everywhere. Kratos can attack to create hits, but the grab won't 
stop until Kratos loses all his life.

### Manticore Spawn

It's possible to do a stale reference bug with this enemy by trying to do a ground tether to it when it's frozen. Of course, getting the enemy to land safely on ground while frozen can be a bit tricky.

Trying to Ice Rage the Manticore Spawn enemies too early during their hatching 
animation causes them to be whisked about in a strange way and in the end they 
don't even freeze.


### Chimera

You only encounter one Chimera during the entire game, near the start of Chapter 7. It's Ice elemental.

Unlike most larger enemies, Chimera can be frozen with only a single Ice Rage, but this is not useful as it will immediately unfreeze.

If you Ice Rage Chimera from behind when it's stunned and ready to be mini-gamed (only during its 1st or 3rd phase), Kratos and Chimera may zip a lot since the game has difficulties understanding Chimera's direction. The movement is extremely speedy, but so far neither Kratos or Chimera have clipped out of bounds while doing this.

Another crazy zip you can do with Chimera is by quickly Ice Raging it after doing the first mini-game to it. Hard to even say what causes this zip to happen!

If you break out of Chimera's 1st phase grab with upgrading, Kratos does a curious looking shoulder tackle to Chimera instead of being thrown around.

Casting Ice Magic near the Chimera makes the lion's mane part entirely translucent until the beast thaws again.

#### Chimera mini-game bug

Chimera is a special enemy that is normally intended to be defeated with a finishing QTE while it's stunned. However, if you deal damage to the Chimera while it's in a state where it cannot get stunned, for instance by leaving a Fire Rage bomb that explodes while you Ice Rage the boss, you skip its stunned/mini-game phase entirely. This will cause the Chimera to enter a glitched state where it continues fighting like usual, but it may randomly use attacks from its later phases, especially as a counter to some of Kratos' actions - for instance, it starts walking on two feet shooting ice balls while the snake tail that's supposed to be cut off at this point lacks an animation and is completely stiff. After damaging it enough, it becomes completely tame and simply starts following Kratos around the level while never doing more than a very light snake whip "counter" which cannot even hit Kratos. It cannot be frozen any longer after this point at all. Since it's also immune to damage, the fight is softlocked and you have to retry.

This same glitch works in the 2nd and 3rd phase as well. In 2nd phase, after all its health is depleted, the Chimera starts walking around aimlessly while lazily following Kratos. In the 3rd phase, it follows Kratos around like in the 1st phase, but it can actually a do a more dangerous ice breath counter instead of the completely passive snake whip.

Continuing to do Fire and Ice Rage to Chimera, you can then get Chimera to become completely passive so that it no longer follows Kratos. Tether and Ice Rage also completely phase through its body. I'm not sure why, exactly.

### Manticore

Rarely after retrying, Manticore may be airborne but stuck in an odd pose. This bug should end by itself in around 5 seconds.


#### Manticore mini-game bug

Much like with Chimera, you can skip past the Manticore's mini-game sequences by taking its health down past the mini-game threshold while it's in a state where it cannot become stunned. The same setup of Fire Rage to Ice Rage works here too.

Skipping the phase 1 mini-game causes the Manticore to enter a kind of a combined state between phases, where it may fly around with both wings intact but without being as aggressive and mobile as before. It may sometimes land, and it will usually move around in its aggressive stance, as if it was still phase 1. If it does enter its phase 2 animations, its supposedly torn off wing will be clipping through the ground. Unlike with Chimera, the fight does not become softlocked after doing this glitch, and you can still finish the fight as normal by just continuing to do enough damage to Manticore and do the finishing mini-game on it.

If you skip the phase 1 mini-game and then pass a certain damage threshold while the Manticore is flying, it will spit out some Manticore Spawn while floating in air. After this, it will enter an odd looking combined state between phase 2 grounded movement and flying. Its attacks cannot contact with Kratos at all since they're all horizontally aligned ground-based attacks. Doing Ice Rage to the beast while it's doing a ground action will pull it down to Kratos' height, but it will then slowly rise up again once it starts moving. The flight finally ends once you deal enough damage to activate the near-dead QTE sequence.

Any Manticore Spawn that are spawned while the Manticore is flying cannot land on the ground properly and never unhatch. They just float around immobile in an egg-shaped form and do not react to most of Kratos' attacks. They do take damage, though, and will eventually die if you attack them. Walking into them does a one-time damaging effect to Kratos that can be parried! Grabbing them will cause a displaced grab to take place, after which the Manticore Spawn will finally "hatch", although in a super tiny size. The tiny Manticore Spawn look a bit glitchy, with stiff wing movement and scaled fire attack effects. Using Ice Rage on an unhatched Manticore Spawn will not kill it but instead cause it to hatch properly at a normal size.

If you also skip past the finishing QTE, you get similar results as with Chimera. After damaging the boss enough, it becomes completely passive. It won't move around, won't be targeted by Soul Rage and cannot be frozen, but it will turn to face Kratos. It may lazily counterattack, but all of its attacks phase though Kratos harmlessly. Finally, doing more damage and Ice Rage, the boss becomes even more passive. Now all grabs will phase through its body. It won't turn to face Kratos any longer either. At this stage, the fight is pretty much softlocked and you got to retry.

### Gorgon

The stun mini-game of Gorgons allows Kratos to petrify other enemies in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the mini-game is quite buggy. It can sometimes glitch up and result in nothing getting hit. The directionality is also inverted for a part of the mini-game, making it difficult to steer where you want to.

### Wraith

Doing an Ice Rage to a burrowed Wraith can cause it to become momentarily in a mixed state between being burrowed and on ground. Some other attacks can do this too, I think. Occasionally Kratos can also do a glitchy tethering to a burrowed Wraith that hits nothing - possibly a related glitch.

# Other notes

## Checkpoints

After retrying, you can start moving around a second before the screen becomes visible again. Unfortunately this time doesn't work out like "black-out time" from God of War 1, and you can't bypass cutscene triggers during it.

As usual, you can move checkpoint triggers around by being in air as you hit them. The checkpoint becomes buffered and activates the next time Kratos lands somewhere. However, in this game checkpoints apparently can't activate inside cutscenes, probably to prevent some glitchiness. Note that this doesn't always stop glitchiness from occurring.

For some reason after retrying Kratos or enemies can be in t-pose for several seconds.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of an enemy in t-pose after retrying:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=149


## Chests

A simple way to speed up opening magic or health chests is to start opening them as Kratos is sheathing his sub-weapon. Once the sheathe animation is complete, the chest immediately pops open at least half a seconds faster than normal.

You can break out of a chest prompt using one of the break-out techniques. The chest breaks by itself as red orbs start pouring towards Kratos. Manually trying to examine the chest at this time just resets the chest state, so it's not like you can get two times the orbs from the same chest.

Trying to open chests in quick succession (using break-out glitch) can cause the contents of the first chest to disappear entirely. Very noticeable with Eye / Feather chests.

If you have opened an Eye / Feather chest, then open Select-menu a little before the message shows up, the Eye / Feather-message may entirely disappear.


## Cutscenes

You can break-out of some cutscenes. However, time is stopped during most cutscenes, so breaking out is actually not all that useful. Kratos just stands idly as the cutscene happens and you can't control him.

Cutscenes leading to action sequences are a different thing and with a break-out Kratos can freely move during them, potentially causing some more glitches. But this kind of cutscenes are in comparison quite rare.

If a checkpoint starts from a cutscene and the cutscene doesn't stop time, Kratos can sometimes break out of the cutscene by spamming magic after retry. Instances of this and other break-out glitch possibilities are listed way below in the level-specific glitches section.

Breaking out of story-intensive, "important" cutscenes like interactions between characters usually doesn't work out. If you try it, the game most likely crashes.


## Death collision

Rarely, for example during Chapter 8 and 30 autoscrollers, there is death collision that works in an unique way. You can enter the menus before the "You Are Dead" text has appeared, allowing you to do odd things like retry while dying - this causes a glitchy game over screen to appear after retry behind which gameplay continues as normal - or retry checkpoint and quit game at the 
same time (but this is inadvisable since it crashes the game). So far the effects you can achieve with this glitch are not that useful.


## Grapple points

Grapple points are a very high priority prompt in this game and interrupt almost every move Kratos has when activated. This includes magic, whose effects may glitch up if you interrupt them all of a sudden!


If Kratos activates a grapple point instantly after having done a break-out, the game will crash.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=139


## HUD

There is a rare glitch where the HUD disappears from the game, along with subtitles, QTE-prompts and other text overlays that should appear on the screen. Needless to say, not being able to see any of the randomized QTE-prompts will make progress in the game extremely difficult. I've seen this glitch happen once in Chapter 30, but the exact reason for it remains unknown.


## Menus

If you hold X to upgrade something but then switch pages in the menu, the upgrade sound loop will stay on indefinitely, even after leaving the menu. The sound is pretty annoying... but the glitch doesn't end there, you can go back into the menu and overlap the sound repeatedly! You can end the glitch by upgrading something again to end the sound loop naturally. Otherwise the sound stays on and won't end by itself.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa8NVkKRDJY#t=59


## Quick-time Events

Hard to say if it's a glitch or not, but in the early game many of the QTEs succeed even if you intentionally try to fail at them.


## Slides

Those sliding sections are programmed in a slightly weird way, as detailed above in the "Poseidon Tremble speed glitch" and "Shield slide speed glitch" sections.

Passive tether overlaps with the slide and no break-out can happen. It seems upgrade break-outs also do nothing at slides.

If a checkpoint starts from a sliding section, it's sometimes possible to escape from it by rapidly pressing X upon retrying.


## Mysteries and hypothetical glitches for future

### Data-less world weapons

Findlestick recalls that a long time ago, at the start of his first playthrough, he was in front of the gates leading up to the first boss fight and he managed to glitch up the world weapon there so that, when picked up, it was invisible and its attacks felt like they had weird momentum. He says he was trying to overlap the L1+O 'ground pound', both ground and air versions, or possibly a Sword discard, with the Sword pick-up animation, when it had happened by accident. He didn't play around with this mode for too long since he had tried to discard the invisible weapon shortly thereafter, thus ending the glitch.

The description makes it seem like findlestick might have accidentally entered an elusive state where the game thinks Kratos is holding a specific sub-weapon but its data is not loaded for some reason. This is the exact same mechanism behind "Sky Jump", i.e. the odd levitation that you can get during an Upgrade Jump, although upgrading only gives access to this state for less than a second. In other words, if it was possible to get this state in normal gameplay via a break-out or another glitch, then it might be possible to do levitation on demand in regular gameplay, which would break open Ascension on a whole another level. Findlestick probably didn't see the full power of this glitch effect when (or if) he got it because the data for Sword was probably passively loaded during the time. If he had only kept the invisible sword, it might have turned into a full-fledged levitation in the next map!


# Level glitches

## New Game

## Prologue

There's a small stretch of cinematics and gameplay after starting a New Game that you can't return to from the Chapter Select-menu. Let's call this the Prologue. Chapter 1 won't start until Kratos lands on ground level after his duel with Megaera.


Speed strategy: the game will load for about a 10 seconds shorter time if you start a New Game after having already loaded a save or started another New Game. Although, nowadays this doesn't matter too much since the official speedrun timing begins from after the first cutscene is over.


Other (NG+): you are able to enter Start-menu and turn on bonus items frame precisely before the intro cutscene begins. This allows you to cast magic or do Rages before the game begins proper, but this doesn't do anything else than create short-lived graphical effects.


Other: Prologue break-out

You can break out at the start of the prologue by using jump + tether frame precisely after the first pre-rendered cutscene. This causes Kratos to stand instead of being chained and you are free to move wherever after that. The camera is pretty glitched up right now, but it can be manipulated by casting magic for instance. There isn't much floor here - just a small island of 
collision where Kratos is supposed to be chained and then a small floor beneath it. Anywhere else, you just fall down to your doom. I've tried to leave, but it seems that the next map is not loaded yet like this, so you can't use this trick as a time save... instead you just get stuck.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqOMKOW6szA


Other (NG+): retrying from the checkpoint before the QTE-fight, you can frame precisely cast magic. Unfortunately this doesn't help - this also just creates a graphical effect and nothing more. From what I tried, a tether break-out didn't seem to be possible, or if it is, it is very precise to do.


Random: try as you might, Kratos is unable to die in the QTE-fight against Megaera.


Speed tactic: once Kratos can start attacking, it's faster to just attack with triangle hits and never dodge.

## Chapter 1 - Prison of the Damned

Other (NG+): Megaera madness

You are able to Ice Rage glitch Megaera if you haven't retried from checkpoint or targeted anything else with Kratos since the Prologue. This causes her character model to move around to the spot where you do the glitch. She doesn't have collision and you can't really do anything with her - just touching her causes her to teleport back to her original location.

If you run up to the short cutscene up ahead, things change a bit. Megaera moves to the corner to the right and stays there indefinitely. If you now try to Ice Rage her, instead of Megaera always teleporting to Kratos, Kratos may randomly teleport to Megaera! It's a fairly rare effect, but interesting.

Jumping down to the next corridor and jumping over the pit, then backtracking to the urns, you are able to teleport Kratos inside the next building too. Too bad the lengthy setup makes it unlikely that this would save time.

If you could teleport to Megaera's final location past the collapsing floor, it would be a major time save. But unfortunately that Megaera model is different from the previous ones and cannot be referenced with Ice Rage. In fact, once you activate the trigger that drives away the third Megaera appearance (the one at building entrance), the Megaera object disappears from the memory, ending this glitch.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SdxvAAjHdw


Speed strategy: you can skip the short cutscene at the end of the first road by doing continuous Unarmed jumps against some angled collision to the right and foreground. Once you get far right enough, you've bypassed the cutscene trigger and saved a few seconds. Other side effects include the first bug enemies not spawning and one of Megaera's sound clips not playing.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid (at the start):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI


Other: after jumping down to the lower level, you are still able to return back to where you came from using a slightly higher double jump followed by an Unarmed Jump. But doing this is not wise since if you load and then unload the next area - innards of the building - it will never load again and you may even get stuck in the game.


Wasted potential: you can't escape the collapsing floor cutscene by backtracking from its range using buffered actions since it horizontally repositions Kratos to ensure Kratos always falls down to the same spot.


Other: if you double jump into the collapsing floor cutscene, you may accidentally activate a destructive checkpoint glitch.

Normally Kratos should become checkpointed before falling through the ground, but due to the delay caused by double jumping may cause him to become checkpointed after landing downstairs instead. If you now retry from this glitched checkpoint, you see the pre-fight cutscene all over again, this time without any actors. And your game is stuck - have to restart.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chZA5IocExs#t=23


Random: the very first Bugman enemy you meet is a bit different from the rest and will never become vulnerable to a finishing mini-game, probably because this would mess up the tethering tutorial.


Sequence break (NG+): the first tutorial fight can be escaped early, but you need an impractical amount of height to do so.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WA3v4x_X3E


World weapon: Kratos can get multiple Swords in the first fight against Megaera's Minions.


Wasted potential: in Chapter 17 when you're re-visiting this same area, you're able to backtrack to the corridor after Martyr's Chamber with two Unarmed Jumps since there is some invisible floor nearby. But sadly this doesn't work in Chapter 1.


Wasted potential: you can get on top of the walkway you're supposed to tear down after the fight with a precise Unarmed Jump. But there's a big gap in the walkway up ahead, and so far it doesn't seem possible to jump past that too.


World weapon: there's a Sword lying on the outdoors path before the large gates.


Wasted potential: after opening the door and stepping outside, you can buffer a backwards roll or another action to try returning back inside before the door slams shut before Kratos. However, there's an invisible wall blocking the doorway even before the door has slammed down, so this won't work. Furthermore, even if this was possible, chances are that you'd just fall out of bounds since the outdoors and indoors areas are separate maps.


World weapon: enemies drop Sword in the fight before the first boss fight.


### <Infected Hand of Aegaeon pt. 1>

Random (NG+): Soul Rage souls apparently cannot find and attack this boss. Same is true for the next few bosses as well that take place on moving platforms.


Infinite red orbs: if you have Sword, you can keep attacking the boss endlessly to farm red orbs. Just don't activate the grapple mini-game to continue as long as you want. This is very slow and arduous, though, not really worth it.


Other (NG+): many graphical effects, like Soul Magic, look completely ridiculous when done on moving floor like this fight is on.


Other (NG+): if you cast magic at the same time you activate the mini-game to end the first phase of the boss fight, this boss may glitch up. It will simply become frozen in place with the mini-game prompt still hovering above its head. Nothing happens until you go and re-examine the mini-game prompt, after which things proceed like normal.

The same works at the 2nd phase of the fight as well, so you can get the boss frozen in a pose there too.

Other: if you retry during the section where you slide down, Kratos' position seems to become displaced. He immediately falls out of bounds and get killed once gameplay continues. Another retry fixes things.

## Chapter 2 - The Sewers

Other: you can jump on top of the inner sewer corridor doorway after climbing up the sewer wall. This lets you see a glimpse of some out of bounds area above the tunnel. However, you can't really go anywhere from here because you're surrounded by walls on all sides.


Sequence break: Kratos can skip the climbing bit after coming out of the Sewers with Poseidon Tremble high jump on top of the sewer corridor archway. This jump is possible on New Game too with an Unarmed Jump, but it is much more difficult, requiring the use of tether to break out to land more precisely.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b8vlY-OlyI


World weapon: enemies drop Javelins in the first fight after climbing up.


Other: Kratos can get on top of the doorway to the next area using Unarmed Jumps. If you're careful enough, you can touch the trigger that starts the cinematic "slow walking" mode of the corridor but then walk leave via out of bounds to do some cinematic slow walking outdoors! You can't activate R1-prompts during this time, so you're in danger of getting stuck. Getting hit by 
any enemy will free Kratos again and he regains normal movement, though.

Going over the gate early can't be used as a time saving tactic. This is because the game will crash after you've walked deep enough. It will always crash if you have not lowered the gate in front of the corridor, because some important trigger is tied to that action.

If you get enough height near the doorway, then jump inside towards the cinematic walking corridor, you might end up inside the cells with other characters and also skip a loading trigger that makes the game load the next area. This causes Kratos to fall down to his death at the end of the cinematic walk.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aE5sYFNVYQ#t=379


Other (NG+): normally the enemies waiting nearby in a cage are invincible. However, if you retry from last checkpoint (the one at the start of the climb), you are able to hit and damage any enemies with magic. This lets you start the fight early. If you kill all the enemies, you can activate the switch that opens the next area even though it is still barred. Also, if you pull the switch that opens the cage after killing the enemies, you get a cutscene where no one rushes out from the cage.

This would be a speed strategy, if it weren't for the fact that skipping the climb is faster than skipping pulling the switch that starts the fight.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0FvGdqKxeE


Other / speed strategy: skip the cinematic prison hallway walk

Normally Kratos enters a slow walking mode when entering the prison wing ahead. However, by doing the passive tether animation (with R1) while jumping into the hallway, Kratos will break out mysteriously. A weapon discard works too, although it is more difficult to do. Kratos needs to be at top height and at the start of his discard animation when hitting the slowdown trigger, and 
afterwards he is free to move like normal. This allows you to quick roll through the place instead of slowly walking, if nothing else.

But you can also mess around by going out of bounds here... so far it's not been possible to do additional skips by going OoB though.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ciVTQlyxw#t=181

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=58


Other (NG+): doing magics before enemies spawn can cause them to become knocked on the roof of the building. You are stuck until you manage to defeat the wayward enemies from the rooftop.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chZA5IocExs#t=58


World weapon: you could probably get a Sword from any of the fights in the large, moving set piece.


Random (NG+): failing to escape when the building collapses, Kratos is taken away by the big hand and you soon get a game over. But the game doesn't limit Kratos' movement in any way, so you can still cast magic and do other things during this time, looking strange.


Other / Wasted potential (NG+): if you enter the next grapple point while doing air specials so that Kratos has some air momentum in reserve, he will freeze in air for a moment. Afterwards he may be able to regain control in air before actually landing at Guardhouse. So what's the use? Not much, as of yet. You can move the Guardhouse checkpoint around this way if you wish. You can also do a high jump to get to the other side of the Guardhouse early, but unfortunately the game crashes if you do that.

On one rare occasion, I did a weapon discard when I used the grapple point, causing Kratos to become idle during his flight. The Guardhouse was also unloaded, so he fell into nothingness shortly after. Perhaps this was some kind of a rare break-out?

## Chapter 3 - The Guardhouse

Other: Guardhouse glitch

Rarely this chapter can glitch up when entering it. You'll know it has happened if the camera stays zoomed in on Kratos instead of zooming out to show the whole yard. If you go pull the switch, the ladder descends and gate rise up like normal - but there's no cutscene! Finally, pulling the crank and activating the Cyclops fight also works, but no Cyclops spawns and you get stuck.

If you retry from last checkpoint you finally get the Cyclops to spawn. So in other words, in certain circumstances this glitch would actually save time if it could be done at will since you skip one cutscene. But then you have to retry to finally load the Cyclops and continue playing.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2If52Cy-U


World weapon: there's a Sword lying in the Guardhouse yard.


Random: you can activate the checkpoint on top of the small building early by jumping there instead of using the switch and the ladder. So far this doesn't seem to cause anything special to happen, though.


Out of bounds: you can go out of bounds at the Guardhouse building by trying to jump around the roof's left-hand railing in a certain way. Kratos can land on small stretch of ground there and walk some way out of bounds.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ciVTQlyxw#t=207



Wasted potential: the grapple switch becomes disabled during this fight, preventing you from both using it early or doing Ice Rage glitch shenanigans like potentially dropping the Cyclops out of bounds.


Speed strategy: you don't have to climb the ladder to reach the grapple point - instead do a "slightly higher double jump" close to the higher platform to the left where you'd normally latch onto the grapple point and Kratos can reach it early. On NG+ you can use Poseidon Tremble to make this really easy.

But don't use the grapple point and jump to the other side too fast, because otherwise the game can crash.


Other: if you retry after having activated the grapple point, the prompt of the grapple switch becomes visible again for some reason. But you can't pull it to any direction and it doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever.


Other (NG+): you can do magic break-outs at the checkpoint after bursting through the wall. Basically, just retry from the checkpoint and spam R2 and see what happens. Ice or Lightning Magic causes Kratos to break out of the cutscene for good, and it seems after that there's little else to do than promptly fall to your death. Fire or Soul magic interrupts the cutscene for a few seconds before returning Kratos safely into it, and things progress as normal.

### <Infected Hand of Aegaeon pt. 2>

Other: this boss can't be targeted by ranged attacks like Javelins. Souls also ignore it.


Speed strategy: by being close to the boss and spamming R1 as it is falling down sometimes allows you to do an early mini-game to it, saving a few seconds.


Other: the game can softlock in the 2nd phase of the fight. Occasionally the boss becomes invulnerable and never enters another mini-game phase. It seems this is related to luring the boss to the left side of the arena, so just to be safe, don't do it in speedruns.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ip3ThJ5G8


Wasted potential: the presence of Bug-enemies on the battlefield makes it really easy to create stale reference bugs, like Ice Rage-glitch, but they don't seem to do anything to this boss.


Other (NG+): if you cast magic simultaneously as you activate the finishing prompt, the finishing scene may become glitched up. The timing is very precise, though.

Doing Fire or Soul Magic, the boss will start the finishing scene on its own with the mini-game prompt still hovering above its head. Meanwhile, Kratos casts the magic. Once the magic animation is over, the finishing scene starts all over from the start.

Doing Ice or Lightning Magic, the boss will start the finishing scene on its own, but soon it stops and returns seemingly to normal for a while. Then it freezes entirely, and you can no longer damage the boss or make it react in any way - you're stuck. You can also see Megaera hanging on the boss' side if you look down.

### <After boss fight>

Speed strategy?: you can do a small checkpoint warp here. Retry as soon as the intro cutscene to the next place starts. Afterwards the cutscene is over and Kratos can just go on his way. Although it's still not tested if this truly saves time since reloading takes some time as well.


Other: if you complete this area too quick, the game will not have enough time to load the next cutscene properly. Megaera's sound bite is missing and there are no enemies either. This means that you get stuck because you can't activate the elevator until dealing with the absent enemies. What an awful thing to happen in your speedrun!

My recommendation is to jog lazily to the switch and back instead of running at full speed. That should be enough so that this annoying glitch doesn't happen.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=21


Other: you can lure the first batch of Bughounds out of the elevator zone if you want to. If you then examine nearby things with R1, the enemies will wait passively until you're done, which looks a bit funny. Defeating the final enemy near a prompt also creates a new checkpoint next to one. You can then examine a prompt as the in-game cutscene showing the elevator plays, although sadly this overlap doesn't seem to do anything too interesting so far.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of overlapping a prompt with the elevator cutscene:
        https://youtu.be/HxMGUpxNZi4?t=40


Other: Javelin shots auto-target towards the large elevator in this area for no particular reason.


Other: you can do a tether break-out when examining either of the R1 prompts that let you examine the things here. This lets Kratos move a little bit or do attacks after having examined the wall mural for instance. After the small waiting period is over, the game interrupts whatever Kratos was doing - this side effect could cause glitches, if you had time to actually go and do anything else during this time. Which you sadly don't.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/g57GVc34LCk?t=25


Other: doing a charged Sword attack or Unarmed air attack from a certain height will make Kratos hit death collision right underneath the elevator, making it seem as if he fell through the elevator floor to his death.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=49


Other: if you lift up an elevator lock but then let it descend back down, it doesn't have collision any longer and Kratos can walk inside it.


## Chapter 4 - The Hecatonchires

note: from hereafter "Hecatonchires" is referred to as Heca


Other: you can R1 the door multiple times during the fade-out. However, this doesn't really do anything.


Other: breaking out of the sensual cutscene

You can tether break-out of the long story cutscene after opening the door, allowing some crazy sights. You first have to do a well-timed tether break-out as the screen is fading out after opening the door. Then another tether break-out a little after Kratos steps into the room. After that Kratos is free to move during the cutscene until about the half-way of it.

You can do special attacks to mess up the camera during the cutscene, but you can even go further than that: you can jump up to bring the real Kratos to appear on screen alongside the cutscene Kratos!

It seems difficult to utilize this break-out to do really useful things, though. Kratos is standing on some temporary platform that is very small, so moving just a little causes him to fall down and you can even die during the cutscene. So far it seems you can't go early to the next areas either, and you will eventually lose control of Kratos during the cutscene since it keeps re-positioning Kratos in the background. Oh well, at least it looks fun.

World weapon: the enemies in the first fight carry Javelins.


Random: during the short cutscene where Megaera says Kratos has hurt her for the last time, Kratos is in fact completely free to move and do attacks. If you're on NG+ and do magic or Rage attacks, the camera focuses on Kratos instead of Megaera.


World weapon: the enemies in the second fight carry Swords.


Random: the fight where Heca's teeth balance the arena precariously works by some pretty strange rules. It's like an autoscroller and it doesn't seem to matter what you do during it, except at the very end. The amount of damage you deal to the teeth doesn't seem to matter - just that you keep attacking them at the right time.


Other (NG+): sometimes killing all the enemies at once with some magic can cause them to stop respawning during this part.


Other (NG+): if you cast magic while failing the autoscroller, sometimes Kratos won't get a game over. Instead the camera shows Heca's smug face from above while Kratos is free to do attacks in his gut. It lasts for a while until the game over mercifully cuts things short.

Other (NG+): doing Ice Rage against the infected arm causes the Ice Rage glitch reaction for some reason, causing the game to target objects like Heca's teeth from the previous fight. This doesn't cause anything interesting to happen, though.


Other (NG+): reaching the phase of the boss fight where you assault Heca's head with the infected arm, if you retry, you are able to do a magic break-out of the event by spamming magic. With good timing, Kratos becomes free to move while the infected arm goes through its grapple motions. But eventually Kratos is insta-killed mysteriously and falls through the ground.

Other (NG+): when QTE dueling against Megaera, if you retry and spam magic, Kratos breaks out of this scene too. He falls down after casting the magic and you can see the environment from a strange angle. There is some floor you can walk on under Heca's face, for some reason. But trying to go anywhere doesn't seem possible since there's a lot of insta-death boundary below. It doesn't seem to be possible to long jump to the lower area early.

## Chapter 5 - The Village of Kirra

World weapon: there's a free Club close to where you start the level.


Sequence break (NG+): skip Juggernaut fight and rope section (c: AKheon)

First of all, the trigger that starts the Juggernaut fight does not extend far left. So if you use an extended Poseidon Tremble high jump, you can get on top of the higher platform to the left and thus evade activating the Juggernaut fight in the first place.

After this, there is a small problem since you are unable to push the movable box anywhere from the right side because there is some invisible collision in the way. Yes, this collision only disappears after having fought those Juggernauts... so what to do? You can either go turn the crank to lower the rope and complete the map like "normal", albeit without the box. But this is fairly slow.

You can also skip the remaining area with a single high jump (on NG+). Go to where the movable box is originally located, then climb the building to the right. You can use an Unarmed Jump to get on top of the little roof there, and from there do a Broken Destiny jump to get to the top. However, you need to squeeze everything out of your jump here or else you hit some angled collision that drops Kratos off. It can be annoying to pull off. My advice is to start the Broken Destiny motions from a relaxed double jump - this gives you more length instead of height, and helps to get across.

2, AKheon's vid of a more difficult, outdated jump variation:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-U4V82-OL4


Sequence break: other skips in the first area

Using "slightly higher double jump" you are able to do two different (mutually incompatible) skips in this area.

First, you can jump on top of the higher platform at the left without needing to use the movable box at all. However, you have to complete the puzzle and lower the rope for this to be useful at all, so it's still fairly slow.

The more useful variation is to drag the movable box beneath the higher ground where there are some planks and use slightly higher double jump to grab a ledge there. You skip the entire puzzle when doing this.

On NG+ you can do either skip with a Poseidon Tremble high jump as well, should be slightly easier.

Random: the Javelin and other ranged weapons tend to target the crank machinery instead of other targets in this area.


World weapon: there's a Javelin after the rope crossing.


Other: sometimes the bug enemies up ahead will be glitched up and not "real" 
enemies. You can't attack them nor will they attack you. This might happen only 
if you access the upper areas via an unintended route.


Sequence break (NG+): skip Fire of Ares

On NG+ you can skip the entire Fire of Ares section in a somewhat bizarre way. 
First go up to the Fire of Ares door. Then use Fire Rage against the door and 
the urn, then do a Fire Magic once the tutorial message asking you to do Fire 
Magic pops up. For some reason this makes the game think you completed the 
tutorial fight, allowing Kratos to pass through early.

As a bonus graphical glitch, if you leave to the next area and then return back 
to the Fire of Ares map, its graphics are glitched. Some things are not visible 
until returning to the door.

Videos:

Wasted potential (NG): theories to skip Fire of Ares

It would be cool if you could skip Fire of Ares in NG-conditions. If this was possible, you could finish the game without collecting any elements. What's more, Kratos could also probably get infinite Rage or Magic from the Fire of Ares-tutorial by escaping it early. Unfortunately, right now this is not possible.

Unlike Ice of Poseidon, the Fire of Ares urn is placed too far away to precisely clip through the door behind it with an Unarmed air attack.

The wall collision in this room is at least as high as the gate itself, so it will be hard to cross with your low-powered high jumps in NG. There is no invisible ledge on top of the gate either. Lowest point in the collision is probably near the outer edge of the nearby building (between the building and the wooden pole). From there you can access a small out of bounds niche, and with a few more (less high?) jumps, you might be able to seamwalk around the gate.

It's possible to use a stale reference bug to take the movable pedestal from the previous section to the higher area, but the object will unload during the short climb before Fire of Ares and therefore even threotically it couldn't be moved right next to the Fire of Ares door for some extra height.

You could probably use Sling levitation to go over the door, but Slings only become available in the next area after passing the Fire of Ares door.


Other (NG+): in general the Fire of Ares door is pretty strange and doing Fire 
Rage when approaching it for the first time can cause the Satyr enemies to 
spawn before you've even picked up Fire of Ares. If you start the Fire of Ares 
tutorial fight with the enemies already spawned, it seems the game doesn't know 
what to do and the fight will never end.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of various glitches at the Fire of Ares door:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igQix4o17OI


Other (NG): findlestick mentioned that if you retry a moment before using the Fire of Ares-prompt, Kratos returns to the previous checkpoint but he now has Fire of Ares and an empty magic bar.


Infinite red orbs: at the Fire of Ares tutorial, the game expects you to use a 
Rage attack on an enemy. If you refuse and keep killing the enemies, the game 
will spawn them infinitely. If Kratos has a Sword, he can slowly drain an 
endless amount of red orbs from the stream of foes.


Sequence break: you can skip the Satyr General fight by doing an Unarmed Jump 
to as far left as you can from the higher platform (before dropping down). This 
way Kratos activates the camera that shows the fight starting but doesn't 
actually spawn the enemies or the fight barriers, allowing him to continue on 
his way without issues.

On NG+ it's even easier to do a variant of Broken Destiny long jump a bit to 
make your jump longer and less precise to pull off.

Videos:
1, a part from a speedrun where this trick is used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDqv61wmIvw#t=183


World weapon: you'll find a Sling on the path before climbing up towards the 
water wheel.


Other: retrying from the checkpoint before starting the big climb, the nearby 
chest becomes colorless and gray for a few seconds until the colors reload 
again.


World weapon: there's a Javelin in front of the water wheel.


Random: the Satyrs here can't be frozen with Ice Rage.


Sequence break (NG+): using a customized high jump, you are able to skip 
touching the waterwheel grapple switch at all. You also skip the preceding 
fight against the Satyrs and the cutscene that would follow.

Just using Broken Destiny high jump motions with a good air momentum is barely 
enough to do the jump, but you got to start the jump from the slightly elevated 
side of the ramp. So carefully jump to the edge, then do a similar Broken 
Destiny jump that was used at Kirra Juggernaut skip to make it across.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9rCOMg7rTk


Speed strategy: kill only two of the Sling Satyrs here to avoid starting an 
annoying filler cutscene. This way you can use the waterwheel grapple switch 
without wasting as much time. (c: Robin Fleming)


Speed strategy: don't pull the waterwheel down all the way. Only enough for 
Kratos to barely make it on top of the rising platform.


Wasted potential: it would be possible to skip the fight at the collapsing bridge if you could get over the whole area using some unrealistically high jump.


Other: Breaking bridge shenanigans

You can avoid having the bridge break by jumping down to the fight arena over the wall of the abandoned building (with an Unarmed Jump). This causes a small difficulty later on as you can't climb up from the fight area since the bridge still exists, so you have to climb around it.

So what's the use of preventing the bridge from breaking? No use, really. But 
after fighting the Gorgon you can use the bridge as a one-time platform to jump 
back to where you came from... only to find out that things on that side are 
now unloaded and that you can't backtrack anyway.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9RlQqlAak#t=124


Untested: you could probably skip the fight after the collapsing bridge by 
using Sling Discard jump. There is for instance some floor on top of the 
archway leading to the bonus area which you could use for this purpose...


Other: somehow it is possible to accidentally fall out of bounds when the 
bridge breaks under Kratos. Kratos then becomes checkpointed on some floor out 
of bounds and is stuck there.

World weapon: there's a Club nearby after the bridge breaks under Kratos.


Sequence break: Gorgon fight skip

The Gorgon fight starts if you hit a trigger right at the top of the short 
stretch of ladder. So do your best to avoid it by jumping off the ladder and 
getting to the top using a Broken Destiny or Unarmed Jump instead of climbing 
up. Avoiding the area close to the ladder and rolling quickly, you can continue 
on in the game without having to bother with this fight at all. (c: 
findlestick)

The prompt to open the door is not active if you skipped the Gorgon fight, so 
now you have to clip through the right side of the door to get past it. My 
suggestion for doing this is having Kratos face left, then doing sideways rolls 
towards the right side of the doorway. Afterwards everything should work like 
normal.

Also, sometimes after having done this skip, Kratos is hit with some strange 
mode for a second or two where he freezes up. If you are sprinting during this 
time, you keep moving and can in fact breach walls during it. If you're lucky 
this will also get you through the closed door. Or if you're unlucky, it will 
drop Kratos out of bounds to his death.

Videos:

2, AKheon's vid of the phenomenon mentioned in the third paragraph:
       https://youtu.be/zaoG_RH6uDY?t=26


Other: approaching the Gorgon fight from a wrong direction can glitch the pre-
fight cutscene and the fight itself up. The pre-fight scene wil be aligned 
wrong - Kratos walks to a wrong direction during it and the camera shows you an 
out of bounds area instead of the Gorgon. At the end, Kratos may accidentally 
walk out of the combat arena and fall down before the fight has even started! 
But this isn't very useful since you can't get back up to fight the Gorgon 
after leaving, getting you stuck.

Since the triggers for Kratos freezing and the Gorgon appearing are separate, 
it's also possible to start the Gorgon fight cutscene but have Kratos free to 
move during it. If you approach the exit door, after a certain limit the Gorgon 
will de-spawn unceremoniously.

Other: duplicating Gorgon Eyes?

GameFAQs user Veladus reported an interesting thing that had happened to him on 
his playthrough. He had played up to the start of Cistern and picked up the 
Gorgon Eye chest on top of the bridge before backtracking and visiting the 
secret area with a roller he had missed earlier. After dying inside the puzzle 
a few times he had managed to complete it. But when returning to the Cistern, 
it had completely reset itself - enemies were back, and the chests were reset 
too, so he was able to pick up an extra Gorgon Eye. This should be verified, 
and see if it is possible to repeat this procedure to fool the game into giving 
Kratos even more early Gorgon Eyes. ยง


## Chapter 6 - The Cistern

World weapon: there's a Sling lying nearby as you enter the Cistern corridor.


Wasted potential: it seems the water effect at the bottom of Cistern is just cosmetic and you can't use it to start swimming glitch. The same seems to be true for the water under the bridge in the following maps as well.


Other: for some reason the lighting of the climbing section can glitch up and 
go mostly black. Nothing is visible except the various light and mist effects 
of the area. This effect lasts all the way up to the part where Kratos boards 
the snaketrain. It's unknown what might cause the glitch.

segment runs, though. (c: vipeazone)

Random: there's an out-of-bounds white cube underneath the climbing section after the slide, but it can't be reached because of death collision.


World weapon: you can get a Sword from a Satyr during the Ice of Poseidon 
fight.


Sequence break: you can skip the whole Ice of Poseidon by doing an Unarmed Jump 
to the side of the urn. Kratos will clip through the side of the urn upon 
descending if you're lucky. Yeah, it may take several tries to make it work, 
but it is still always worth it in a NG+ speedrun. (c: Robin Fleming)

Speed strategy: in the Ice of Poseidon tutorial fight, grapple throw all 
enemies to the corner that's left of the gate. Then, once they're all grouped 
together, charged Club air attacks will hit them all at once for massive 
damage.

Videos:
1, a part of a speedrun where this trick is used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDqv61wmIvw#t=229


Wasted potential: it was tested with a glitched Shield what happens if you get on top of the higher walkway early (where you normally come from in Chapter 12). It has collision but no camera angles, and it seems to lead nowhere.


Other: you get a small camera glitch if you activate the snaketrain prompt with 
Kratos facing away from it or doing actions like sprinting.


Other: you can cast a magic frame-precisely before the cinematic to the next 
area for a harmless graphical effect during the ride.


Speed strategy: hold down R1 as the snaketrain is about to stop to latch onto 
the grapple point early. This saves a few seconds.


## Chapter 7 - The Tower of Delphi

Out of bounds: climb the staircase to the top. If you do an Unarmed Jump or Poseidon's Tremble jump before exiting through the doorway, you can land out of bounds. You can visit the wrong side of the Tower this way - it's a pretty decent-sized OoB area.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=167


Wasted potential: the top floor of the tower has a ceiling which prevents you from jumping to the roof of the tower from underneath.


World weapon: a Javelin is lying on the path to the top of the Tower.


Other (NG+): any souls created here attempt to fly towards the Manticore perched near Temple of Delphi instead of attacking nearby enemies. This target is too far away for the souls to reach, but if you use a glitched Shield to get closer before casting Soul Rage, you can see that the souls actually don't even hit the Manticore but rather an empty spot near it, and they don't cause any kind of hits while doing so.


Wasted potential: I tested escaping the Chimera fight and returning back to the lower floor using a glitched Shield. However, the Manticore eggs are despawned and can no longer be used to do Ice Rage-glitch to displace Chimera or try out other stale reference bugs.


Other: the Chimera object ceases to exist in the game's memory and can no longer be reached with a stale reference bug once the grapple switch appears.


Other: if you break out of the grapple switch, you are able to position Kratos 
heavily to the left as you finish pulling the grapple switch. This way, when 
the snaketrain comes, you can jump inside it much earlier than the game intends 
to be possible. This causes Kratos to start sliding before the entrance 
cutscene even finishes, which is a bad thing in this case since you don't have 
any control over him! Kratos will always slides into the pit and dies, and 
therefore this can't be used as a speed tactic, sadly.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/XmgB1XLJNKg?t=115


Wasted potential: skip snaketrain entrance cutscene (and get stuck)

You can skip a short scene when entering the first snaketrain by jumping around 
the cutscene trigger with a basic double jump. However, this has severe 
consequences later on.

The short cutscene is actually for masking loading times. Skipping it and just 
rushing ahead carelessly, the snaketrain never enters its correct position. The 
collision inside acts strangely, with some sliding parts broken so that Kratos 
starts normally walking while on them. In the next fight the graphics are 
displaced and you have to be careful with the chasms since they're displaced 
too.

Finally - you get stuck at the top of the Tower when returning there in Chapter 
9 because the critical grapple switch never became reset and can't be activated 
after beating Manticore. So this trick can't be used for time saving.

If you do this trick but wait a while before entering the slide, the next parts 
of the game act normally instead of being glitched since the game had more time 
to load things. But you still end up getting stuck at Chapter 9 end.

As another interesting side effect of doing this skip, there's a gaping hole in 
the invisible wall at the top of the Tower. You can jump out of it after riding 
the first snaketrain, but there's nothing but insta-death floor below.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMMvO0kBPzg


Wasted potential: I used glitched Shield to jump all the way to the Temple of Delphi early, but it's just an unloaded cardboard cut-out at this stage, so this is not useful.


Wasted potential: after boarding the snaketrain, you can long jump back to 
where you came from but the Tower has no collision and you just fall to your 
death.


Wasted potential: you can zip from the first sliding part of the level to the 
end of Chapter 8 if you're careful. Basically, use Poseidon Tremble speed 
glitch here, then after sliding down the corridor a bit, you need to go out of 
bounds and fly a long way to the left (?). This will land Kratos to the 
vertical ice slide he uses at the end of Chapter 8. You will skip Lightning of 
Poseidon doing this, and Chapter 8 will never show up in the Chapter Select-
menu afterwards.

Otherwise fine and dandy, but it seems that doing this skip in any of its forms 
causes a game breaking glitch at the end of Chapter 9, when returning to the 
center tower. No cutscenes start and you just get stuck.

World weapon: you can take a Shield from the enemies inside the first 
snaketrain. This is the first known place in the game you can get a Shield, 
which means from this point the Shield Jump and Upgrade Jump are options for 
Kratos.


Speed strategy: one of the fastest ways to win this fight is to activate all 
enemies and then group them together, then cast Ice Magic. This shatters the 
flying enemies, disarms the Shielded Satyrs and freezes them all at once. Then 
just break the Satyrs and you've won. Unfortunately sometimes an enemy can 
evade the Ice Magic range, but mostly this is a pretty consistent strategy.

If a flying enemy does evade the Ice Magic, just to be safe you don't want to 
use Ice Rage here to quickly shatter them. Why? Because if you miss the target 
and hit one of those Manticore Eggs instead, you may accidentally target a dead 
enemy, which makes this fight unwinnable.


Speed strategy: you can environmentally kill enemies here with grapple throws. 
Environmental kills are possible in many later fights in this area as well.


Other: if you're unlucky, a flying enemy can fly out of bounds during the fight 
inside the snaketrain. If you can't reach it, the fight barrier never 
dissipates and you get stuck.


Other: some graphics in this part of the game can suffer from random pop-ins 
and other oddities. You can see a floor of a snaketrain fade in and out of 
existence as Kratos moves around it, for example.


## Chapter 8 - The Python's Belly

Speed strategy?: by doing a long jump, Kratos can skip the short Lightning of Zeus intro. However, it's unknown if this is worth it since you may have to do Shield-discard jump to fly far enough, and losing Shield is a pretty bad thing. If you do skip the intro, you can then freely move around the battlefield without activating it, as long as you don't jump in air.


Wasted potential: using Shield attacks or Hyperion Ram, you are able to slip Kratos behind the left pillar next to the Zeus door. But so far it's not been possible to entirely clip through the Zeus door to skip this part.


Sequence break: skip Lightning of Zeus

First of all, the loading trigger for the next area is down close to the 
Lightning of Zeus power, so you have to drop down whether you like it or not.

Down inside the room, you can use an Upgrade Jump to escape the area before or 
after picking up the power. Doing the Jump before picking up Lightning of Zeus 
is a legitimate cutscene and fight skip, although fairly costly since Upgrade 
Jumps are valuable things. If you escape during the tutorial fight instead, as 
a side effect Kratos is forced to use Lightning power and can't switch away 
from it for the indefinite future... which is probably something you don't want 
to happen. (c: findlestick)

Nowadays there exists another method of skipping Lightning power that doesn't 
need an Upgrade Jump (v2). There's some floor on top of the pillars that Kratos 
can just barely land on during a Shield Jump. With a precise motion you can go 
around the invisible ceiling that is in front of Zeus door and hit the top of 
the pillar without Kratos instantly falling off it. After that you just jump 
through the ceiling and escape without ever getting Lightning of Zeus. From 
quick tests, it seemed like using the left pillar is better to use for this 
trick. However, it's not consistent enough to really use in a single segment 
run for instance. (c: AKheon)

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q0ECDe8G5g


World weapon: Kratos can acquire a Javelin or a Club from the Lightning of 
Zeus-fight.


Wasted potential: you can use Poseidon Tremble super speed glitch at the 
sliding part after getting Lightning of Zeus to skip to the end of Chapter 8 as 
well. It's quite difficult to do, as expected. One direction that worked for me 
was to move forward to get out of the collisions of your current snaketrain, 
then aim to the right and down sporadically.

You can also accidentally go so far that you get the title "Ice Caverns" on 
your screen. But it doesn't seem like this helps skip straight to Chapter 9, at 
least so far...

Unfortunately it seems that doing this skip in any of its forms causes a game breaking glitch at the end of Chapter 9, when returning to the center tower. No cutscenes start, the Tower of Delphi itself is not loaded at all in the background, no Manticore appears and you just get stuck.

Videos:

Other / wasted potential: you can get on top of the snaketrain of the first climbing section, although it quickly becomes so steep that it's impossible to go any further. The camera also glitches up, preventing you from seeing anything. There's a chance you could latch onto the next grapple point from here with Upgrade Jump or the like, but you might miss some loading triggers that way.


Wasted potential: you can break out of the large climbing section in a few different points with either circle or using Rage while leaping across distances. I tried Poseidon Tremble at these parts to find some magnetic ledges to possibly skip parts of the climbing, but to no avail. However, it's hard to be thorough with a large climbing area like this.


Other / wasted potential: after climbing up for a while, Kratos reaches a 
grapple point that leads to him breaking through the wall of the next 
snaketrain. You can in fact do a Shield Jump to end up on top of the snaketrain 
instead of breaking inside it. This makes it possible to quick roll through the 
part you'd normally slide, which is not very useful since sliding is faster. 
Also, the camera becomes glitched in a fairly game breaking way.

You can play at least up to the next fight, but after that it seems impossible 
to find the grapple point leading to the next area...? It's likely that it's 
not loaded correctly, since its range is so big you'd think it was easy to find 
even without seeing things properly. So you get stuck.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5pTanmyMI#t=287


Other: the grapple point for breaking inside the snaketrain is oversensitive 
and can be re-activated after you've already activated it once.


Speed strategy?: if you retry from the checkpoint where Kratos is sliding down, 
he can jump up in air the first moment and do Poseidon Tremble super speed 
glitch to get through the slide extra fast. But using this glitch is always a 
bit risky... Not to mention with the extra loading times, this trick might in 
the end cost more time than it would save.


Wasted potential: I tested if it was possible to skip the fight after the slide sections using glitched Shield. If you could jump all the way over the invisible wall and a large gap, you could land on some floor on top of the upcoming grapple switch and operate it from there. However, this makes the following QTE to look graphically glitched and become unwinnable even if you give the right prompts.


Other: during the cinematic part where there's a QTE fight against a Manticore, 
you are able to do the elusive "get a game over inside a menu" glitch by 
opening either menu at a precise time as Kratos falls to his death after 
failing the first QTE.

Other: skip rest of Chapter 8

After the long cutscene of the snaketrain moving into place, you can use 
Poseidon Tremble super speed glitch to skip the small bout of sliding and 
climbing close to the end of the chapter. This shouldn't be too hard to do even 
in a RTA since you can latch onto those grapples from a wide area or even fly 
close to the vertical ice wall. Personally I have the best success with this 
trick by doing a long double jump down the slide before doing Poseidon Tremble. 
After hitting the slide with Tremble, I spam air attacks and steer to the left. 
Kratos may get stuck on some collision there for a little bit, but you can 
always re-steer from there more to the right to reach the grapple points.

Afterwards you can skip the last fight of this chapter as well since you can 
activate the grapple point leading to the last snaketrain early if you're close 
to it before the enemies load.

Other: at the end of the level, you can use the first grapple in the series to 
do a Shield Jump back on top of the ruined snaketrain you came from. Probably 
not useful, and the camera refuses to follow you to this out of bounds area 
anyway.


Sequence break: at the end of the series of grapples, Kratos is supposed to 
latch onto a huge wall of ice and slide it down. Don't do this. Instead, from 
the final grapple, do a double jump at the top height towards right and follow 
it up with Shield air attack. At the very right, tap R1 for Kratos to grasp the 
next grapple point early. This way you skip a fight.

However, doing this skip in a fresh save, Chapter 9 never appears in the 
Chapter Select-menu afterwards. So that is an unwanted side effect.

## Chapter 9 - Ice Caverns

World weapon: Kratos can acquire a Javelin from the first autoscroller fight.


Other: for some reason elemental combo finisher effects are in slow motion 
during the first part of the autoscroller. Doing "Captain Planet" glitch yields 
impressive results as the multiple elemental finishers all pile into one slowed 
down mess.


Other: inside the snaketrain slide that interrupts the autoscroller, steering 
as much to the right as you can sometimes lets Kratos slip past the death 
collision on the way, letting him fall out of bounds. But this doesn't seem to 
be very useful since there is nothing beneath.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/R8Tqnly5-Qw?t=81


Other: at the end of the snaketrain slide, it's not a good idea to steer to the 
left too much either. This is because jumping let or steering more to the left 
lets Kratos fall down the vertical ice wall faster than normal, and if he is 
too fast, he will miss the snaketrain that is coming and dies! So yeah... no 
rush.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/R8Tqnly5-Qw?t=96


Other: occasionally some Bug enemies can spawn late and they appear along 
Kratos as he is sliding down the snaketrain.


World weapon: Kratos can get a Club from a later autoscroller fight.


Sequence break: skip a part of the snaketrain ride

Using Poseidon Tremble slide glitch, Kratos can fly directly back into the Tower from the final slide sequence. This skips a fairly lengthy cutscene and isn't too hard to do even in an RTA. Going upstairs, nothing is loaded on the roof at first - and not even the camera follows Kratos there. But the solution is to just wait near the ladder for the game to finish loading the necessary data. After that the Manticore fight and cutscenes before it start like normal.

However, if you do fail the trick, there is no checkpoint close by and so the 
game sends Kratos back to the last part of the autoscroller - almost two 
minutes of time waste in a speedrun! As a backup strategy, do your best to keep 
Kratos in air before the checkpoint at the last part of the snaketrain 
activates, by doing a Broken Destiny jump for instance, along with Lightning 
Magic when Kratos is about to land. This causes Kratos to become checkpointed 
much later during the ride and you don't lose as much time if you fail the 
trick.

Other: as mentioned, just waiting for long enough causes the snaketrain to 
reach its destination without Kratos. If you high jump or Poseidon Tremble 
glitch yourself to stand on the nearby mountain ridges, you can see this 
process for yourself from a scenic viewpoint. And once the snaketrain has 
stopped moving, you can go and jump on top of it to have it warp backwards and 
reach its destination a second time. (c: vipeazone)

Speed strategy (NG+): unlike when facing Chimera, Souls work just fine against 
Manticore. So those are a good ranged attack for when the Manticore is flying 
and out of reach.


Wasted potential: considering the Manticore does freeze momentarily when you 
attempt to freeze it, you'd imagine you could shatter it using the environment 
to your advantage. But so far doing this is hard, probably impossible...


Other (NG+): If you do Ice Rage to the Manticore twice as fast as possible when 
it is on ground level, you get a glitchy reaction and the Manticore slides 
around a little without freezing.


## Chapter 10 - The Temple of Delphi

World weapon: a Club is lying close to where you enter the Temple.


Sequence break: you can skip the Cerberus fight after it has started by doing a 
Shield jump over the metal bars.

An alternative but not much faster way to skip the fight is to jump over the 
trigger that would start the whole fight. This skips the short pre-fight 
cutscene as well as a bonus. Hey, if you have an Upgrade Jump to spare, go for 
it... (c: findlestick)

2, findlestick's vid of using Upgrade Jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXHErQ7SDaA


Speed strategy: you skip unfolding the staircase by doing a Shield Jump.


Other: the Cerberus and other enemies unload when you touch the sacred mist up ahead, preventing them from being reached with stale reference bugs after that.


Other: if you do a Shield Run away from the first sacred mist as Kratos is 
touching it, he will keep running through the whole duration of the cutscene. 
The camera will glitch up if you go too far. (c: vipeazone)

Videos:
1, vipeazone's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ89NboYi1s#t=70


Out of bounds: after breaking the first door using sacred mist, the walls 
nearby are low and you can drop Kratos out of bounds with a Shield jump. So far 
this is not very useful, though.


Sequence break: skip most of Temple of Delphi

First of all, you can skip the long cutscene where Castor and Pollux are first 
introduced by doing a Shield jump against the side of the doorway. Kratos can 
clip through and get into the main area without having to kick the door open 
(which would start the cutscene).

Secondly, you can use a series of Shield jumps to get directly to the platform 
where you break the giant hourglass. First touch the sacred mist, then quickly 
roll up the left path. Break the door, then do a Shield jump on top of the 
door. From there you can jump through the ceiling with another jump. Do the 
Shield jump continuously to reach the lowered chandelier. If you were quick 
enough, the sacred mist effect is still ongoing, allowing you to shatter the 
hourglass and reach Castor and Pollux fight instantly. (c: AKheon)

There is an alternative, faster way to do this but it requires an Upgrade Jump. 
After touching sacred mist, do an Upgrade Jump (with hovering) to get over the 
invisible wall in front of Kratos and land directly on the chandelier. (c: 
findlestick)

Note that if you do this skip on New Game, the game will never unlock Chapter 
11 in the Chapter Select-menu.

2, findlestick's vid of using Upgrade Jump to cut some more corners:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyuEhj2hszM


Sequence break: another way to get to the hourglass room early is to jump over 
the wall of the corridor upstairs and drop down there. But in a speedrun, the 
above method is faster.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFg1E2SMrI#t=92


Other: consequences of going to the hourglass room early

If you used a shortcut to reach the hourglass area early, be careful near the 
hourglass because jumping in its vicinity - especially going to its right side 
- may crash the game. You can still get to the upper level, but completing the 
puzzle like this is not possible because one of the doors in the upper level 
can't be destroyed right now.

If you activate the hourglass cutscene early, the camera will show you an empty 
elevator shaft. Then the camera will become stuck in this position!

Jumping into the elevator chasm is wasted potential because nothing is loaded 
below.

I think it's possible to play on in the game even from here and end up at the 
Catacombs of Delphi. Later on when returning, the door leading to the hourglass 
room is invisible and can't be opened, causing you to get stuck. (Or this is 
the assumption at least. Should be tested at some point.) ยง

2, Robin Fleming's video of the invisible door:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofYttfkLJnc#t=31


World weapon: a Club is lying on the right path from the main hall. You can 
also get a Shield from the approaching Satyr.


Speed strategy: if you want the collectibles from the right path, you can skip 
having to push the statue if you touch the sacred mist, then jump in air and 
keep doing Blades air attacks as the platform rises back up. With good timing, 
Kratos will end up standing on the platform.

An alternative way is to do a Shield Jump on top of the barred gate before 
fighting the enemies and from there jump to the collectibles.

## Chapter 11 - Delphi Catacombs

Out of bounds: you can go out of bounds by Shield jumping over one of the 
locked doors on the upper level. So far not useful.


Speed strategy?: doing a Shield Jump against a specific wall, it's possible to 
drop down to Delphi Catacombs without using the mist. Sometimes the prompts on 
the lower floor can't be activated after doing this, sometimes they can. I 
guess this trick still needs to be examined more to see if it can be used as a 
speed strategy or not.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQwjl67wBj8#t=192


Wasted potential: it's been verified by both findlestick and Wulf2k9 that even 
if we could skip Soul of Hades-tutorial fight, nothing would be loaded behind 
the big gate.


World weapon: you can get a Sword from the enemies in the Soul of Hades fight.


Speed strategy: you can use Ice Rage glitch to slightly speed up the moving of 
the stone block to the left side of the room.


Other / speed strategy: you can upgrade break-out of the grapple prompts where 
Kratos breaks open some mist valves and causes the hanging platforms to lower. 
This allows him to move freely during the time the sequence is happening, and 
might save a little time.


Sequence break: after reaching the area with sacred mist and barred gates that 
you normally disappear using the mist, you can ignore the mist entirely and 
jump over the gates using Shield Jumps. The gates are conveniently just as high 
as they look, and the developers accidentally left a small gap for Kratos to 
get through from the top.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFg1E2SMrI#t=39


Other: in the same area, the flying enemies can get stuck below ground in some 
circumstances.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da1iYLnbWpU


Other: sometimes the final gate before re-entering the hourglass room does not 
spawn, or so it looks like.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajRmKCKYEw0


Wasted potential?: you can Shield run outside the Wraith fight during the pre-
fight cutscene and thus skip it. Not sure if this is useful, though, since you 
probably can't complete the hourglass puzzle the normal way if you do this.


Other: rarely you can clip past the bars to the right of the hourglass and 
reach the corridor with chests "early". The corridor has lighting issues in it, 
and it's easy to jump out of bounds over the walls.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFg1E2SMrI#t=63


Wasted potential: it's possible to Ice Rage glitch the prompt of the swinging 
platform in front of the hourglass. But it can't be utilized to break the 
hourglass early or anything.


Speed strategy: you can climb the hourglass quick by Shield jumping on top of 
the statue's hands carefully. Find out the spots where there is collision 
Kratos can stand on and use them to get to the top with multiple jumps.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFg1E2SMrI#t=80


Other: perhaps by doing things in wrong order, the pillar close to the 
hourglass Kratos is supposed to tear down fails to do that. You only hear the 
sound effect but nothing happens.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYTq8zFSUM#t=38


Speed strategy: from the balcony behind the hourglass, you can quickly get back 
to the lower level by Shield jumping over the painting.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQFg1E2SMrI#t=134


World weapon: you can get a Shield and / or a Sword from a Satyr during the 
fight at the lower floor revisit.


Other: all enemies must be killed before the stone block can be moved. Rarely 
the game may get mixed up and never end the fight, or the flying enemies have 
wandered too far away, causing Kratos to get stuck here. This seems to be an 
unfortunately common problem...


## Chapter 12 - The Oracle's Chamber

Other: I tested some things in this area using a glitched Shield. If you jump over a very tall invisible wall, you can return to the cutscene-only area at the end of Chapter 11. But it's surrounded by even taller invisible walls preventing you from progressing anywhere else. I also tried reaching the Oracle's throne like this. It has no collision, so Kratos just falls down.


Speed strategy: you can skip the grapple point in the middle of the platforming 
section by doing a Shield Jump over the pit instead.


Wasted potential: you can use Poseidon Tremble speed glitch on the small stretch of sliding to fly directly to the boss arena. Nothing is loaded there at first, but the throwable rocks will pop into existence within a second or two of waiting. Unfortunately, the boss himself will never appear no matter how long you wait. The foreground of the arena also won't collapse given enough time like it does when the fight has started normally. Casting Soul Rage during this time makes the souls target towards some unknown location in the background, possibly where the boss' character model is currently situated, but due to the camera it's impossible to know for sure.

If you're close enough to the front of the arena, Kratos may enter the range of the slide QTE and get teleported there suddenly. Doing the QTE then begins the fight like normal, although there is no music during the boss fight if you start it like this. Additional glitches might become possible if you combined the slide QTE with other actions like throwing the rock or a tether break-out, but so far it has been so impractical to test that no one has done it.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhojEtOgnA


Other: if you complete the platforming section too quick by f.e. doing a Shield Jump into the final slide to save a second or two, the acrobatic QTE-sequence at the end never begins and Kratos falls to his death. Another trap for speedrunners...


Other: using a long jump, you can go to the other side of the chasm and interact with the boss before you've thrown the rock and officially started the boss fight. The boss can be hit but he doesn't react to anything in any way. Wulf2k9 has looked into the game's memory and discovered that the boss actually has 10000 health at this point. If you hit the boss long enough to drain all of that HP away - this will take around 5 minutes with fastest possible damage-per-second - he will vanish without any bigger ceremony, leaving Kratos all alone in the fight arena.

Throwing the rock while the boss is around will start the fight like normal. Throwing the rock at the boss when he is already at 0 HP seems to do nothing, the boss will just continue with his vanishing routine as usual.

2, AKheon's vid of damage killing the boss:
        https://youtu.be/trhojEtOgnA?t=102


Other: rarely, the first rock you throw at the boss doesn't register at all and instead bounces away harmlessly.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
	https://youtu.be/trhojEtOgnA?t=86


Other: you can do Ice Rage-glitch using the throwable rocks around the area. The destructible pillars also work for this purpose.


Wasted potential: you can't bypass the boss' usual health thresholds with Ice Rage since the boss doesn't really have a dedicated reaction to being hit with this attack.


Other: if you use long-range Ice Rage on the boss before the start of the fight, he will vanish mysteriously into unknown coordinates. Casting Soul Rage makes the souls fly away to a direction somewhere far away behind and below the arena. Obviously, the fight can't start like this and you get stuck.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIZsb_ujGtc


Other: if you use long-range Ice Rage on the boss after throwing the rock, you can displace him and make him fall into the pit for a moment. This will glitch up the fight, making it unwinnable. After the boss has done his ground-pounding attack, he enters a curious "passive" state where he rarely attacks Kratos and doesn't register as an active target for f.e. Soul Rage-souls. If he does attack Kratos, most of his attacks phase through without doing anything. The boss can end up in this state in some of his other phases as well, but in all of these cases, the fight cannot continue and you have to retry.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/EIZsb_ujGtc?t=32


Other: if you use Ice Rage to displace the boss during the scripted sequence where the floor is collapsing, you can get him to fall inside a pit. This glitches him up, again making him enter "passive" mode, as detailed above.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pL4Y5Lvh5A


Other: the boss may naturally fall into a pit as you destroy the final pillar that he is standing on if the ground in front of the pillar is collapsed. Falling into a pit, as detailed above, makes him enter a "passive" state where he cannot die and barely attacks Kratos, and so the fight is softlocked.

Videos:
1, Wulf2k9's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-am2SSoG70


Speed strategy: when the next phase of the fight begins and the boss teleports on top of the pillars to taunt you, you can break one or even two of the pillars before the short cutscene begins.

To speed up the actual breaking of the pillars, you can use Soul L1+t. This attack creates a local damaging effect at the boss' feet, which instantly breaks the pillar he is standing on. So just spam the attack a few times to destroy the rest of the pillars easily.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/vwAaKL44wnA?t=48


Wasted potential: with a precise timing, you can do Soul L1+t into the cutscene where boss teleports on top of a pillar. This will destroy the pillar early during the cutscene, but it seems this will also make the floor become destructible, like it does in the later part of this set piece. Because of this, the floor collapses underneath Kratos during the cutscene, which always results in a game over.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/trhojEtOgnA?t=147
	
	
Other: using Ice Rage-glitch on the boss while he is on the pillars can be risky. If the boss is in the middle of teleporting to another pillar, Ice Rage-glitch will displace Kratos instead of the boss, usually dropping him out of bounds. However, if you're careful, you can get close enough to the pillar the boss is standing on to do Ice Rage to it. This will shift the boss' location very slightly, eventually causing him to fall down either inside or outside the arena. In either case, the fight is now stuck. The boss is immune to Kratos' attacks as well as the deadly pit underneath the level. Destroying all the pillars won't help you continue the fight either - it's just totally softlocked.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/EIZsb_ujGtc?t=79


Other: you can displace the boss or drop him into the pit before the special QTE-sequence. This will make the event become stuck one way or another. If Castor falls into a pit before the white-out, he never re-emerges from there and the cutscene leading up to the QTE-sequence will never begin. If Castor falls into a pit after the white-out, he will get displaced, and the QTE won't work properly, causing the boss to endlessly swing at nothingness instead of Kratos.

You can also break out of this part by spamming X (and maybe R1) while the 
screen is white. Kratos becomes free to move and the fight continues earlier 
than it should, with the cinematic special effects like strange camera still 
active. But again, you can't win the fight like this, so while it looks cool, 
it's not useful at all.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pL4Y5Lvh5A#t=98


Other: if you intentionally ignore the boss while he is weakened after the special QTE-sequence, he will get back up and start the preceding floor collapsing sequence all over again. You also get checkpointed again around this time. If you displace the boss with Ice Rage-glitch at a wrong time, he becomes displaced inside the checkpoint as well. If the boss gets displaced out of position, the special QTE-sequence can't start like intended and the whole fight becomes unwinnable.


Other: rarely, the phase of the fight where Pollux takes over happens without music. The music won't come back until it's time for the finishing cutscene.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/trhojEtOgnA?t=172


Wasted potential: you can use Ice Rage-glitch to move the boss closer to Kratos during the special sequence when is hovering over the arena and cannot be reached. However, it turns out he is invulnerable during this time, so this is pointless.


Speed strategy: casting rage or magic right before the cutscene where the boss drops the oracle allows you to stay next to the boss instead of getting knocked away. This leaves Kratos in a better position for the finale, saving a second or two.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/vwAaKL44wnA?t=157


Other: you can displace the boss with Ice Rage right before the cutscene where he drops down the oracle. This will make the cutscene look slightly odd, and the boss will also remain displaced as the final sequence of the fight begins.

The boss will then collapse all the floor in the area while displaced. Since he is not in the middle tile, he will probably fall down much earlier than Kratos will. But as we know already, he has nothing to lose from all this since he is immune to the death floor below while Kratos isn't. The finisher QTE sequence also takes place displaced, which at least looks somewhat humorous, even if doesn't seem to be useful in any other way.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/EIZsb_ujGtc?t=178


Other: sometimes the boss may get a permanent slow down ring around him in 
the final checkpoint. It doesn't matter much since the fight is almost over, 
but it still looks strange. It slows down all other Kratos' animations except 
the finishing QTE.


Speed strategy: during the part where Castor is trying to collapse the whole arena right before the final QTE, he is not defeated by damage but rather by the amount of hits you do to him. Apparently 11 hits is required to continue. Possibly the fastest way to do this is to use Lightning L1+s with full Rage and switch elements during the attack so that Kratos fires two projectiles instead of one. Soul L1+t also causes a large number of hits within seconds. (thanks to GMG)

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/vwAaKL44wnA?t=157


Mystery: for unknown reasons, sometimes Kratos can have more than one second of free movement during the black-out between cutscenes before landing down on ground level. It might have something to do with displacing the final QTE. Alternatively, I though that this glitch only happens on your first run through the level and cannot happen if retrying from last checkpoint. But the truth is unknown, I've never found a way to do it consistently.

Why is this of any interest, then? It's almost certain that Kratos' character model already exists on the ground level during the black-out time, and if you had the freedom to move during it, he could quick roll forward and possibly activate R1-prompts or hit a new loading trigger ahead of time. It might save time in a speedrun or cause other odd glitches, but at the moment this effect happens rarely with no known way to recreate it, and remains a mystery.

1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/EIZsb_ujGtc?t=260


Other: on occasion I've tried breaking out of the post-fight cutscene by spamming jump into tether as the screen fades out. A full break-out has never happened, but a few times the post-fight cutscene has played using a wrong camera angle. So perhaps that is the best you can do with a tether break-out in this scene?

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/trhojEtOgnA?t=219


Mystery: a game breaking glitch can rarely happen after the boss fight. Kratos picks up an invisible Amulet and he is unable to use its power, becoming stuck in the game. If you take a look at your gear, the Amulet is there but it has no graphic.

Videos:

Wasted potential: I tried retrying at multiple points after the boss fight to see if I could get Amulet into the boss fight, but nothing.


## Chapter 13 - The Passage of Delphi

Sequence break: you can skip fixing the bridge with two Shield jumps. First, 
use a Shield jump to get to the higher level. Then, you need to do a continuous 
Shield Jump to bounce over the soft collision that there is a lot of before you 
finally reach the other side.

The camera does not fix itself after having talked to the Oracle if you do this skip, so you have to do the short climbing section blind. Fortunately the camera will get fixed after that.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGOnr1GDJOw


Wasted potential: you can jump over the cutscene of meeting the Oracle, but the 
next area will not load afterwards.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid of jumping over the Oracle cutscene:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYTq8zFSUM#t=114


Other: trying to upgrade break out of the Oracle cutscene crashes the game, but you can tether break-out if it to watch the cutscene with no animations or sound. Kratos and Aletheia will lay idly while a part of the cutscene audio plays in the background. Waiting for long enough makes the cutscene progress as usual.

After the pre-rendered part everything returns to normal again. However, with very precise timing, you can X and R1 a second time to break out of the second part of the cutscene as well. Kratos and Aletheia again wait idly doing nothing until the allotted time for the cutscene is over and gameplay resumes. At that point the camera starts doing its regular cutscene motions even though Kratos is free to move. All dialogue is also inaudible. Although the result looks vaguely amusing, it may make it harder for you to make it to the next area in a speedrun, so it's not necessarily recommended.

Kratos' jump becomes longer and he lands on solid ground instead of having to 
hang on the ledge first, saving a second or two.


Sequence break: Amulet of Uroborus tutorial fight skip

There are multiple ways to skip the upcoming fight where the game tells you 
more about the Amulet. The fastest known method is simply to Shield Run through 
the pre-fight cutscene before the gate becomes lowered to block Kratos' path.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z55ia4Fwwro


Other: the Amulet tutorial fight can end early if you shoot at the gate 
carelessly using the Amulet, at least at the very start of the fight. ยง


World weapon: you can get Sword, Javelin or Shield from the enemies in the 
Amulet tutorial fight.


Other: the green Amulet screen effect sometimes becomes stuck on screen after 
retry once you've fixed the large bridge. It should become fixed by progressing 
onward in the level, or if you activate Amulet again at the bridge.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9RlQqlAak


World weapon: there's a free Sword just waiting to be picked up before 
reaching The Cistern. You can also get Swords from the enemies that appear 
along the Siren.


Speed strategy: if you fix the bridge after the Siren fight as close to the 
edge as possible, you actually skip a cutscene that would start after fixing 
the bridge.

Doing this also glitches up the checkpoint for The Cistern: when returning to 
this chapter, Kratos starts from near the chests instead of near the waterway 
like usual. Trying to return into the waterway causes the camera to follow 
Kratos in a delayed way. You see the bridge fixing cutscene (where nothing 
happens) when entering the waterway, and there are not one but two Swords lying 
around the place!


Other: The green Amulet effect can get stuck in this part as well after a 
retry. The effect is stuck with Kratos until you reach beyond the Cyclops fight 
and the game loads new areas.

## Chapter 14 - The Cistern

Other: if you backtrack to the bridge you just fixed, you can decay it again if 
you want - with Kratos still standing on it. This is probably unintended, and 
looks pretty funny.

Videos:

Sequence break: skip Cistern re-visit fight

You can skip the Cistern re-visit fight with Shield Jumps. First, go to the 
left end of the waterway where the chests are and enter a small hidden platform 
above them with a Shield Jump. Once Kratos is in it, he is a rather tight spot 
and can't do other jumps, so you have to come out of there and aim a little to 
the foreground and then heavily to the left with your next Shield Jump. If you 
do two Shield air attacks to the correct direction, then follow it up with some 
Broken Destiny motions, you are almost guaranteed to end up in the corridor 
where the painting is, skipping a fight and two small cutscenes in the process. 
(c: findlestick / AKheon)

An older method involved dropping down to ground level from the hidden platform 
on top of the chests. After the fight begins, you can inch by the ground level 
and go around the fight barrier blocking the exit, continuing on your way. But 
the above method is both easier and faster.

2, AKheon's vid of the outdated skip method:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed54PywsXH0


Sequence break: skip Cyclops fight

You can skip the Cyclops fight by jumping over the small house-looking 
structure to the left before stepping into the fighting arena. But the jump you 
need to do must be higher than a normal Shield Jump - you need an Upgrade Jump 
or a Combined Tactics Jump for example. Once on the structure's roof, you can 
keep jumping to reach the other side and never encounter the Cyclops. (c: 
findlestick)

A new way that you can do without Upgrade Jump involves breaching a wall. The 
two statues on both sides of the doorway have a collision flaw in them, and 
Kratos can breach the outer corners using a Shield normal attack against them. 
This allows him to go out of bounds, although be careful as there isn't much 
floor there. It's worth it to interrupt the Shield attack with L1 to prevent it 
from going too far once Kratos slips through. You should go out of bounds from 
the right side, and from there Shield Jump / drop down to the bonus area 
entrance. From there you can skip the Cyclops fight and bridge fixing sequence 
like usual. (c: AKheon)

One final, arguably easiest way to do this skip is to Shield Run through the 
Cyclops fight cutscene to the right to go out of bounds of the fight area, then 
do a Tremble ledge magnetism to one of the corners of the statue to drop down 
to the entrance to the secret area. The worst part is that you have to watch 
the pre-fight intro cutscene, making this variation on average slowest to do. 
(c: Robin Fleming)

Sequence break: you can skip fixing the bridge when backtracking to the water 
wheel with a simple Shield Jump from the ground level.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuL99Gh3YHM


Other: if you retry from the checkpoint after having fixed the bridge, the 
green Amulet effect will affect the camera for no reason. The effect stays on 
until you progress onward in the game to the sidling part up ahead.


Sequence break: you can skip the water wheel revisit intro with a few well-
placed jumps. There's a trigger that starts the intro cutscene as soon as you 
land on the stone bridge, but you can avoid hitting it if you land on the 
bridge from very far right. So do a Shield Jump that lands on the right end, 
for example, and then follow it up by double jumping carefully. Now you're past 
the trigger and didn't have to watch the cutscene.


Sequence break: skipping water wheel puzzle

First way to skip the entire water wheel fixing sequence is by using an Upgrade 
Jump. Just Upgrade Jump (with hovering) your way up to the part of the bridge 
where you activate the last Amulet prompt. The water wheel becomes fixed 
instantly if you do this, so after that you can just fix the waterway and this 
chapter is over. However: this tactic might not be mutually compatible with the 
previous waterwheel revisit intro cutscene skip. So it overall may be faster to 
do the intro cutscene skip and use the below speed tactics instead. (c: 
findlestick)

Even without using an Upgrade Jump you can still cut a few corners during this 
puzzle. First, you can get to the top of the wheel early by doing continuous 
Shield Jumps over the angled collision. You can fix the wheel entirely in just 
one go if you're standing at the top. Then just jump on the small part of the 
aqueduct and fix that too. Puzzle solved.

2, AKheon's vid of the second variation:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuL99Gh3YHM#t=14


Other: there is a glitched Amulet point on the top of the broken bridge. If you 
activate Amulet close to the waterwheel, Kratos attempts to fix something with 
the Amulet, but in vain. You can try to create or decay, but that just makes 
Kratos fist pump uselessly. After letting go of Amulet, the green Amulet-vision 
is still active indefinitely, so this is definitely a glitch.

## Chapter 15 - The Grotto

Speed strategy / swimming glitch: while descending into The Grotto, there's a 
moment where the game does not stop time and Kratos is free to jump or roll off 
the water wheel platform. This has a twofold purpose: first, just falling down 
and hitting water skips a part of the scene and you regain control of Kratos 
quicker than normal. So it's a good speed tactic. Second, jumping in a specific 
way, you fall out of bounds and start this chapter with "swimming glitch".

For speed purposes, being able to get out of bounds is not invaluable, though, 
since the route to the next area is fairly direct and you can already skip most 
of it with Shield Jumps. But at least you can do some swimming exploration in 
the process.

Just to warn you, jumping down in a wrong way rewards you with a softlock or 
death, but a surefire way to simply land in water in a speedrun is to hold r-
stick down to roll of the platform. This always works, and Kratos can save some 
seconds in this part of the game.

Interestingly, if you do die in this part of the game, you can accidentally 
become a victim of a secret softlock. When Kratos is returned to the previous 
checkpoint, he refuses to jump onto the descending waterwheel platform, 
therefore causing you to get stuck. No amount of retries will fix this, and you 
have to restart the entire chapter to continue.

3, AKheon's vid of the softlock:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHFTiVOnSKY


Random: there's a strange blue flame floating out of bounds somewhere near the 
Grotto. You can find it using swimming glitch.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=46


Swimming glitch: a second way to get swimming glitch in this chapter is to do a 
high jump near where you start the section. It seems there is some floor on top 
of the angled wooden pole above the two chests to the very left, so if you 
Unarmed Jump there, you can land on something and jump then even further and 
get over the walls to the left.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa8NVkKRDJY#t=106


Sequence break: you can skip the two Talos fight and having to lower the gate 
by Shield jumping over the gate instead. The camera may be bad for a few 
seconds after doing this, but just dive and things should become fixed.

An alternative way is to use swimming glitch to go around the fight. But you 
need to hit a certain loading trigger in the preceding underwater corridor and 
also start the Talos fight to load the next area. This method is not difficult 
either.

Videos:
1,, findlestick's vid of both methods:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSBhz9h8Rhk


Speed strategy: somehow you can do a Shield Run through the Talos fight 
cutscene, perhaps by landing in a very precise spot when jumping out of water. 
If it could be done consistently, it would save a little bit of time in a 
speedrun. (c: Robin Fleming)


Swimming glitch: a third way to to get swimming glitch in this chapter is by 
jumping over the walls from on top of the gate during the Talos fight. (c: 
Wulf2k9)


Other: you can end swimming glitch here and go walking underwater if you like. 
It is done by jumping against a certain part in the underwater corridor... 
better instructions may come later. ยง

If Kratos hits the underwater spikes while walking, he permanently freezes in a 
pose resembling swimming and you have to retry.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3tqe6PlCBY


Sequence break: you can use swimming glitch to sneak on the boat early, 
skipping the short wait in the process. Do a slightly higher double jump 
followed by a Shield Jump to the right-hand wall after the last swimming 
section. Once you go out of bounds, the water surface is right there for 
touching.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoLhgFr5xOA


Wasted potential (swimming): the game ends swimming glitch if you enter the 
boat cutscene while swimming, so it looks like swimming can't be taken into the 
next chapter.


## Chapter 16 - The Prison of the Damned

World weapon: you can pick up a Club or a Javelin from your enemies at the 
start of the chapter.


Fight tactic: it's possible to ring-out the Cerberus by riding him near the doorway, then using something like a Fire Plume to knock him over the edge.

Videos:
1, wulf2k9's video:
        https://youtu.be/n43PZqZRWFE&t=38


Other: it's not uncommon for the Amulet of Uroborus tutorial textbox to stay on 
the screen permanently when you're in this level.


Other: if you keep holding down L2 after decaying the rack, Kratos remains in the "decay / heal"-menu that normally becomes unavailable after this point. Pressing R-stick to either direction doesn't do anything, though.


Wasted potential: you can jump on top of the right-side fence and get around 
the building facade where there's the door you examine and start the long 
cutscene of Kratos being tempted again. But nothing is loaded on the other side 
if you don't watch the cutscene. Also, it doesn't seem like you can break out 
of the cutscene using upgrading or via any other known means either.


Speed strategy: after seeing the Kratos being tempted cutscene, if you go to 
the Empusa fight arena before the camera has returned to its usual position, 
Kratos becomes free to move during the fight intro cutscene. This might at best 
save a second or two, so it's not much.


Sequence break: skip Empusa fight

There's an Empusa fight right ahead. You can skip it before even seeing the 
Empusa in two ways. One is to use an Upgrade Jump (with hover) to fly all the 
way to the next rooftop. (c: findlestick)

Another method involves doing a Shield Jump over the archway that leads to the 
battle arena. If you do the Jump at a certain angle, trying to get Kratos as 
far into the room as possible, you miss the trigger that starts the fight and 
can now climb up normally to the roof. This variation is just slightly slower 
than the two other variations, and kind of difficult, but it never hurts to 
have more options. (c: AKheon)

You also can escape the Empusa fight after it has started with a series of 
Shield Jumps. First Shield Jump towards the right side of the wall, where you'd 
normally climb after the fight. The spike fence there is actually a platform 
Kratos can walk on. Then, from the right side do a Shield Jump adjacent to the 
building's roof. Kratos should land on yet another platform. Finally, from 
there it's easy to jump on the rooftop.

The Upgrade Jump method is the fastest, but not that practical since it needs 
an upgrade, so you are in most cases better off using the Shield Jump method 
after the fight has started.

3, a part of a speedrun where the 3rd method is used
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDqv61wmIvw#t=652


Wasted potential: you can Shield Jump over the trigger that spawns the enemies 
before the point you have to use the Amulet again, but it's of no use. Those 
enemies have to be slain before the prompt to use the Amulet appears.


Sequence break: you can skip fixing the rest of the Prison and fight four enemies by doing a large jump to the next area early. This is most feasible on NG, where you can use an Upgrade Jump for this purpose.

First of all, normally four enemies spawn upon landing on the lower level, and you'd also have to fight them because otherwise the prompt to use the Amulet will not appear. However, none of that is necessary if you do this skip. Fortunately it's possible to skip spawning the enemies with a Shield Jump over the trigger. It's easiest to do from the higher area from a somewhat extended double jump.

For the next part, you need to get over a fairly tall invisible wall and then consecutive Shield Jump to the right to hit the staircase leading to the Martyr's Chamber. Finding the right angle can be tricky, but at least retrying doesn't waste too much time since the checkpoint is right there.

The graphics are a bit glitched since you never fixed the prison. You cannot see beyond the doorway at the bottom of the stairs, but there's nothing loaded there at first. You have to wait for a few seconds to be able to enter safely. The screen shakes a little when the next map loads, so that's a good sign to look out for.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video:
       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-h3_v35kHE


Other: doing a continuous Shield Jump, you can skip the first grapple point in 
the series of grapple points. This causes the camera to glitch up for a part of 
the way and music to not play, but otherwise things seem to work out normally.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/R8Tqnly5-Qw?t=223


World weapon: you can pick up a Javelin from the roof after the Empusa fight. 
The enemies there will also drop Swords.


Other: the first decayed chest after going indoors again is unique. If you 
activate Amulet near it and keep holding L2, Kratos will enter the Decay - 
Heal-menu. Trying to use either option yields no results, though: the chest is 
healed automatically like usual.


## Chapter 17 - Martyr's Chamber

Wasted potential: with a precise jump you can avoid touching the floor of 
Martyr's Chamber and thus skip its intro. But this way the following area does 
not load... at the very least the floor of the room has to be touched for the 
next area to load.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=20


Other: this area is one of the best places in the game to try out the elusive "ledge magnetism" glitches, since the back wall has several easy spots for doing them. For instance, face the back wall just to the right of the metal box, then do a double jump followed by Ice L1+t (Poseidon Tremble). Kratos should latch onto a very high ledge for no apparent reason.

However, it should be noted that the Ledge Magnetism-glitches in this room stop working after you've utilized the Amulet to free the hanging corpse at the back of the room.


Other: you can jump back up to the ladder you came from with a high jump. However, the area outside has now unloaded.


Other: massive invisible walls appear on both sides of the room while you're using the grapple switch. You can prevent them from appearing if you latch onto the grapple switch from more right than usual.

If you break out of the grapple switch by landing on some uneven collision - some exists right underneath the hanging corpse - any invisible walls that were created remain cluttering the area. You can Shield Jump on top to fall down endlessly for several seconds, followed by a seemingly nonsensical game over.


Other: if you keep holding down L2 after decaying the rack, Kratos remains in the "decay / heal"-menu that normally becomes unavailable after this point. Pressing R-stick to either direction doesn't do anything, though.


Sequence break: the Martyr's Chamber puzzle can be skipped in at least three 
different ways.

For a long while the best method for skipping the puzzle (v2) was dropping down 
into the Martyr's Chamber like normal, then using Ledge Magnetism (with 
Poseidon Tremble) against the back wall to the right of the cage. Kratos should 
latch onto an invisible ledge high above the room, allowing him to jump ahead 
in the level and skip the Scriber cutscene as well. (c: AKheon)

For other methods that don't skip the Scriber cutscene, you can use various 
high jumps to make it up to the exit door. These are called Martyr's Chamber 
skip v1.

But now there is a new method (v3) to skip Martyr's Chamber that also allows 
skipping the Chamber intro cutscene, saving tens of extra seconds. To do this, 
first you need to go out of bounds at the top of the ladder leading to the 
Chamber, which is pretty easy - just do a Shield attack towards the back wall 
on the right side of the ladder, angling the movement a little towards the 
ladder. Kratos will either get stuck to the side of the ladder or start 
falling. Now just double jump and try to move 'up' a little bit with L-stick 
and Kratos usually ends up inside Martyr's Chamber but just out of bounds so 
that he misses the intro cutscene. From here it's the most convenient to get up 
using the elevator, and you can use one of two Ledge Magnetism spots to reach 
the usual spot from where you can Shield Jump past the Scriber cutscene.

One spot was suggested by Wulf2k9, and it's to the left of the metal box, and 
can only be accessed from the upstairs. So you got to ride the elevator, then 
from the upstairs jump a little to the right and Tremble against the wall to 
hit it. An even better spot was later discovered by Robin Fleming, where you 
can skip riding the elevator altogether. Just do the Tremble to the inside wall 
of the elevator to get to the top. All in all it's not a too difficult skip, 
but a very useful one.

Also to note, doing this skip in a New Game file will make the game never 
unlock Chapter 17 since you skip the Martyr's Chamber intro.

2, AKheon's vid of Martyr's Chamber skip v3 (Wulf2k9 variation):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8tZk_NScJM


Other (NG+): if you break out of the grapple switch here with a Rage and then 
try to use Item, Kratos becomes semi-free to move even though he is still 
attached to the switch - this works at other grapple switches too. Being able 
to move and jump like on ground makes the invisible walls that appear while 
handling the grapple switch painfully apparent.

If you had previously put the corpse on the button and start this glitch from 
the right side of the room, you are able to Unarmed Jump on top of some angled 
collision on top of the lifted up box and interrupt the grapple switch mode in 
a glitchy way. Now Kratos is completely free to move, but the invisible walls 
still clutter the place, not to mention you hear the grapple switch sounds when 
you move Kratos. So it's an unique sort of break out. With a high jump you can 
escape the area and continue playing the game, but nothing unusual seems to 
happen as a result of this.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpXQ6DrhRFI


Other: the corpse can start floating in air, becoming impossible to pick up 
again. Findlestick suggested this can happen if you drop the cage on top of the 
corpse and try to pick it up while it is still stuck under the cage, but wasn't 
sure about it.

A 100% certain way to get the corpse to float is to play until the next 
checkpoint (right before Scriber cutscene), retry, then drop back down to the 
puzzle area. The corpse is now floating pointlessly in air.

Videos:
1, findlestick's clip of this phenomenon:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=31


Random: picking up or dropping the corpse in front of the trap where you first 
get it from yields a special camera angle.


Other: you can break out of the Scriber cutscene by doing passive tether while 
jumping into it. This causes Kratos to stand idly facing away from the Scriber 
during the cutscene, as if not interested in anything he has to say. The 
Scriber's dialogue also doesn't play, so it's a very silent cutscene with no 
interaction between the two characters.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1WrF70NW7k#t=114


Sequence break: if you Shield Jump deep enough into the Siren fight room, you 
skip the intro cutscene. This doesn't prevent the enemies from spawning. You 
can later activate the intro cutscene while the fight is going on for tame 
results.

If you did the Scriber cutscene skip earlier, you pretty much have to watch 
this cutscene to fix the glitched camera angle you currently have. So no 
skipping it in that case.


Other: if you skipped the Scriber cutscene, then visit upstairs and come back 
down, you get a really wonky, unique camera angle for the downstairs. Useful if 
you want to see the environments from a new angle.


Other: if you view the Scriber cutscene, then start the Siren fight, then 
backtrack - easily doable with two Unarmed Jumps for instance - the Scriber has 
now unloaded and there is nothing where his cell used to be. You can still 
activate the prompt with R1 to see the text, though.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/DTlMEWb0Og8?t=77


World weapon: there's a Club in the fight room. During the fight itself enemies 
can drop Swords.


Sequence break: the Siren fight can be skipped by jumping to the bridge above 
with a Shield Jump. Easier to do if you did the above Scriber cutscene skip 
because that way there are no enemies pestering you here.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of Martyr's Chamber skip v2 that also features this skip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTErYmjKyUY


Out of bounds: it's easy to drop out of bounds by doing a high jump against the 
back wall of the large prison cell where there's the Siren fight, preferably 
before having moved the block away from the back wall. You can run around the 
room out of bounds, but there isn't much else to do or see here.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYTq8zFSUM#t=60


Other: you can latch onto the moveable stone early, before the fight end 
cutscene activates. If you start dragging the stone at this point, upon retry 
Kratos will start inside the stone block.


Other: if you rush through this area too fast, Kratos will fall down to his 
death after opening the door leading outside. To prevent this from happening do 
some air attacks while jumping through the doorway to slow down Kratos' fall.


Wasted potential: you can get past the cutscene trigger that sends you to Delos 
Landing, but nothing is loaded ahead. So you can't just skip straight to 
Chapter 29 from here.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9RlQqlAak#t=190


Other: you can break out of the cutscene where Tisiphone & Daimon attack Kratos 
by either upgrading or using passive tether. This causes Kratos to remain free 
during the start of the cutscene. Doing magic or other attacks sometimes drops 
him out of bounds, which is strange. When the cutscene reaches the point where 
the QTE begins, it abruptly ends, causing Daimon to float around stuck in a 
frozen pose. He can be attacked and you can build an endless combo this way, 
but you get stuck afterwards.

As an aside note, Tisiphone's character model also glitches up and can be seen 
floating in air near the door if Daimon is facing the right way.

You can also move Daimon around the area by doing Lightning Magic since it 
sucks nearby targets towards it. Robin Fleming even went as far as taking 
Daimon down the stairs and pushing it through the doorway out of bounds!

## Chapter 18 - Delos Landing

Sequence break: you can skip the first cutscene and starting the Satyr general 
fight by doing an Upgrade Jump (with hover) over the cutscene trigger. In a New 
Game-run this might be one of the best places where to use an Upgrade Jump 
since having a Shield speeds up several other upcoming skips as well.

World weapon: the game forces Kratos to pick up the nearby Sword when you walk 
into the first cutscene. This is a bad thing because you'd much rather probably 
have a Shield on Kratos!


Other: often when restarting the game loads two Swords into the cutscene where 
some guy is impaled with a Sword. The other Sword is just floating in air 
eerily instead of looking a natural part of the cutscene. Yet, the glitchy 
Sword has its own R1-prompt and can be picked up.

World weapon: the enemies in the first fight carry Swords.


Sequence break: you can skip the Satyr fight and some cutscenes by doing a 
Broken Destiny high jump up the platform the Satyr General is standing on. From 
there it takes an Unarmed Jump to reach the upper level, and that's it - a lot 
of stuff skipped. However, be careful not to fall down during this skip because 
if you do, the last checkpoint is pretty far away at the start of this chapter.

Other: the R1 prompt near the Javelin on the lower floor can be broken out of 
using air Tether. This causes the cutscene to start with Kratos and the camera 
completely still. Eventually a tentacle breaks the floor out of nowhere and 
Kratos is left standing out of bounds on the broken part of the pier... and 
you're stuck there.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's video:

Wasted potential: going to the upper area and hitting any trigger there forces 
the pier to unload, so there's no chance of doing things in the wrong order 
here in case glitches should occur.


Other: the event of fixing the path to the higher area may glitch up sometimes, 
maybe if you end the fixing process right before it is complete. During the 
glitch visually it seems everything is fixed, but the collision is still as if 
it wasn't fixed and Kratos is blocked from progressing. This glitch fixes 
itself if you continue fixing the bridge again.

World weapon: the game forces Kratos to pick up a Javelin after getting past 
the collapsed area to higher ground.


Other: Kratos can go and hang out with the cutscene-only civilians if he 
reaches the higher area some other than normal route. As expected, they can't 
be interacted with in any real way.

World weapon: enemies in the next fight carry Javelins and Swords.


Wasted potential: you can do a very big LAM high jump to skip the climbing 
leading up to the Juggernaut fight along with the fight intro. Would be a 
worthwhile sequence break otherwise, but the next map does not load this way! 
The intro has to be watched.

jump. Just get over the fight barrier blocking the exit. (c: findlestick)

Other: after the Juggernaut fight but before walking onto the shimmy, doing an 
Unarmed Jump towards your back sometimes lands Kratos on some freaky ceiling. 
So far this doesn't serve any useful purpose, though. (c: Robin Fleming)

World weapon: you'll find a Shield after breaking through indoors. Finally!


Sequence break (NG+): skip the rest of Chapter 18

You can skip the whole last part of this chapter. When you're shimmying through 
the cramped space and Kratos is ready to do a leap ahead... do the leap, but 
then use Fire or Ice Rage as soon as possible to break Kratos out of the leap 
motion. Now Kratos flies further than normal in air and you can use R1 to latch 
onto the grapple point ahead just like that, skipping a whole bunch of 
cutscenes, a fight and a puzzle. (c: AKheon)

As a glitchy bonus, if you don't use the grapple, you fall downstairs without a 
cutscene and with some potential additional glitches like a mysterious wall 
graphic hovering above the level.

However, a word of warning: if you intend to use this shortcut, you MUST wait 
for some extra seconds in the side of the area where you pick up the Shield. It 
also helps to retry from last checkpoint once you've ridden the platform to the 
other side. Otherwise a the next grapple point does not load and this shortcut 
does not work.

Sequence break: Empusa fight and puzzle speed tactics

So, an Empusa appears and you have to solve a puzzle as well. You should go 
break the chain to the right as the first thing you do. You can break it 
without climbing to the upper floor with Broken Destiny (air) or another long 
range special move, saving a little time.

Once the chain is broken, the grapple point comes relatively close and now you 
only need some extra height to reach it early. The easiest way to do this is to 
pull the movable block a little to the right and do a Shield Jump from on top 
of it. Spam R1 at the top of your jump and if you were correctly positioned you 
reach the grapple point, skipping the fight. (c: findlestick)

Doing this skip is easier if you fight the enemies first so that they don't 
interrupt Kratos, although slower. If you decide to not fight the enemies, try 
slowing them down to make them easier to ignore.

World weapon: after completing the puzzle, there's a Club lying on the ground 
ahead.


## Chapter 19 - The Foot of Apollo 

Sequence break: you can skip pushing the large stone and the associated 
cutscene by first Shield Jumping on top of the stone and from there doing 
another high jump to reach the above areas. One alternative is to do an Upgrade 
Jump (with hover) to reach the wooden, circling platform up ahead. This skip 
all the climbing and cutscenes, but costs an upgrade.

An alternative is to do a Broken Destiny jump straight upwards from on top of 
the large stone to end up on the above floor. This way you skip slightly less, 
but it's not a big deal. (c: AKheon)

Sequence break (NG+): you can skip the small cutscene that starts when you 
climb up the ledge ahead by extending your climbing wall leap to skip the 
ledge. To do this, prepare Kratos for a leap, then when he is in air activate 
Fire Rage to make him fly in air longer. Also aim heavily to the right while 
doing this, and it's recommended to follow up Rage with other air attacks like 
Shield air attack. It's quite an easy trick, but saves a good 20 seconds at 
least.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-j998VzS0#t=12


Sequence break: you can skip the fight against Delos Warrior and Harpies that's ahead. The fastest but most costly method is using an Upgrade Jump (with hover) from the area where there's the big wall and a ledge Kratos can hang onto. Kratos reaches the fight area without any enemies spawning and can easily continue on his way.

A second method involves hanging from the ledge, then jumping off and doing a 
Shield Jump over the wall to the right. Now Kratos is out of bounds and can 
jump into the fight arena from under the very tall wall. This is the 
recommended method since it doesn't need an upgrade.

The least difficult and slowest alternative is to enter the fight like normal, 
then Shield Jump over the fight barrier to escape it early.

World weapon: a Javelin is at the higher area after having fought against Harpies and Delos Warriors.


Sequence break (NG): it's possible to skip the entire autoscroller using the incredible horizontal air movement granted by the air-run variation of Upgrade Jump. However, doing this jump from the ground level is not enough; furthermore, the lift is surrounded by some invisible wall that blocks Kratos' movement in air. Fortunately, there is a bit of walkable collision on top of the lift that can be reached with a precise Shield Jump. So get up there, start the Upgrade Jump, do an air-run to the left followed by a droopy double jump into consecutive Shield Jump. Aim slightly to the foreground since the rope is not guaranteed to exist if you're too far away from its normal zone. It's not the easiest trick out there, but it can save up to 40 seconds.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHEWYwcZdMI


Other / sequence break: rarely the game can forget to start the sequence where 
the tentacle smashes the moving platform Kratos is on. This causes the ride to 
go all the way to the other end without issues, then nothing happens. Kratos 
can try to jump onto the hanging stone block in the background, but it doesn't 
seem to have collision. Fortunately the rope to the next area is close by that 
Kratos can still easily hang onto and progress ahead in the game. This saves 
time if it happens in a speedrun.

You can reach the rope early with a Shield Jump if you jump off the moving 
platform at a certain time. This is a guaranteed way to skip the tentacle 
scene, but if you miss the rope, it's a massive time waste since you have to do 
the entire autoscroller section over again.

Videos:

Sequence break: you can skip the block puzzle after the Siren fight by using 
Shield Jumps or alternatively other high jumps. However, you must fight the 
Sirens first or else the next area is not loaded. (c: findlestick)

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid using Broken Destiny jump for doing this skip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTt2pF0gKA


Speed strategy: you can skip setting the platforming cogs in motion with some well-placed Shield Jumps.


Wasted potential: the rope leading to the next area starts from inside the corridor and should be accessible with a Shield Jump without hitting the trigger for the cutscene that shows you the surroundings. But for some reason this just doesn't seem possible. It could be that the rope doesn't exist before the cutscene, or that it can't be grabbed while time is stopped.

Even besides that, the game will move Kratos backwards closer to the doorway if he is too close to the cliff's edge during the cutscene, which prevents you from saving a second or two by doing Shield Run into the cutscene. It's not impossible, but you need a sustained Shield Run with a right angle to keep Kratos moving even after he has been displaced.


Sequence break: skip a large part of this Chapter

On the way to the yard where there's the Centaur and Delos Warrior fight, 
you'll notice a platform above you - it's somewhere you'd normally return later 
after riding the fire elevator. There are grapple points near it which you can 
already latch from down here during a Shield Jump. So get to the right side of 
the platform and do a Shield Jump, then spam R1. Done right, Kratos grasps onto 
the next grapple point high above and doesn't have to bother with the fight or 
using the fire elevator at all.

The next area won't have time to load this way since you're too fast. You need 
to wait inside the menu for a few seconds right before breaking the wall to fix 
this. Otherwise Kratos falls into emptiness.

Videos:

Speed strat: you can also skip riding the fire elevator for the first time 
using a Shield jump inside the elevator to get to the higher level quicker.


Speed strategy: you can skip a small amount of climbing by jumping over the 
collapsing path with Shield jump.


Speed strategy: before reaching The Gauntlet of Apollo, you can skip latching 
onto a grapple point and breaking a wall by doing a continuous Shield jump from 
under the wall. After that, you can skip destroying the insect nest by doing a 
Shield Jump from the left side of the room and latching onto the next grapple 
point from there.

This skip also has the funny side effect of completely glitching up the 
graphics for the next chapter.

## Chapter 20 - The Gauntlet of Apollo

Other: you can go out of bounds and explore a fairly large area to the direction of the boss arena with a high jump. There is a lot of insta-death collision nearby, but with an angled Shield Jump that is done over the wall from next to the bug nest you can land on a wide plateau of floor up ahead while missing the insta-death collision.

Right under the grapple point there is a zone that activates a slow motion effect on demand, so it can be interesting to jump into it and activate this effect at will.

You can break out of the upcoming cutscene too. The trigger for the cutscene is, uniquely, shortly after Kratos lands. So jump once, then quickly jump again while doing passive tether to break out. The end result is that Kratos stands idly in a wrong location for a little while as the cutscene starts, then falls through the floor. This inevitably causes a game over, so unfortunately you can't see the full cutscene like this.

        https://youtu.be/XnSvUBiFpbk?t=244


Wasted potential: you can't bypass the boss' usual health thresholds with Ice Rage since neither Megaera or Tisiphone really has a dedicated reaction to being hit with this attack.


World weapon: the game expects you to take Javelins lying nearby to hurt 
Megaera with. You don't have to, if you can damage her by other means like Soul 
Rage souls.


Other: you can Ice Rage glitch Megaera's model to appear on thin air or other 
wrong places during the fight. This doesn't really help, and she just teleports 
back in a moment's notice. Kratos can sometimes teleport to her too, and at the 
last phase of the fight you can actually get Kratos to fall out of bounds by 
Ice Rage glitching Megaera... but this isn't useful so far.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qDtOhCn61I#t=19


Other: sometimes the game can softlock at the last phase of the Megaera fight. 
Kratos, Megaera and the summoned five Spartan soldiers just stand in place and 
nothing ever happens after that - have to retry from the last checkpoint. This 
softlock might be related to doing Soul Rage at a wrong time as the last phase 
of the fight starts.

Videos:
1, Robin Fleming's video:
       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBWr1bhWWWI

	   
Other: another softlock at this part is that the game might not load any
assets correctly as Daimon swoops in and picks up Kratos. This means the
scenery and Daimon itself are invisible, and the mini-game looks highly
glitched since the camera is not aligned correctly either. The level can't be
won in this state because there is no Daimon to fight against. You're also
softlocked, because when you try to retry, you only return to the start of
this glitched mini-game.

It's unknown if this softlock is related to doing the skip in Chapter 19 which
starts the boss fight in an incomplete state.

Out of bounds: once the 2nd part of the fight starts, you can jump over the 
walls of the fight arena with a Shield Jump and explore out of bounds for a 
bit. Unfortunately there is nowhere you can really go from here.

Other: retrying from the checkpoint where Kratos fights against Daimon and 
spamming X and R1, Kratos can break out of it. He regains the freedom to move for
a moment, and after that may continue doing the mini-game displaced. He can win 
the fight even if his Blade attacks are nowhere near Daimon.

Other: Tisiphone's first phase mini-game glitch

Tisiphone's first fight mini-game can be glitched if you attempt to use it very late, right before Tisiphone recovers. The effect doesn't become apparent until the start of the next phase. Now, doing some damage to Tisiphone makes her enter mini-game mode almost instantly, and activating the mini-game reveals that it's the same one that ended the first phase of the fight! So, the fight is in a strange limbo where Tisiphone's health and A.I. are from the end of the first fight, but Megaera is around as well.

Doing enough damage to Megaera makes her lose her A.I. and she just starts hopping menacingly in place - she is anticipating the sisters' scripted combination attack to start, but it cannot start since Tisiphone is in wrong phase and will not respond to it.

Meanwhile, activating the mini-game on Tisiphone causes a glitchy looking mini-game with an invisible Megaera. Winning the mini-game mostly returns things to normal and the next phase of the fight can continue proper. Losing the mini-game instead causes the fight to revert back to phase 1 and Megaera entirely disappears - apparently she drops out of bounds. The camera will glitch up and go underground for a moment and you become checkpointed... Now the fight is unwinnable, since the next time you damage Tisiphone enough she won't enter her mini-game phase. Instead she just laughs on the spot endlessly! The explanation for this strange behavior is that she is also waiting for the sisters' scripted combination attack to begin, but again, it cannot start since Megaera is nowhere to be found.

One time when I tried out this glitch and Tisiphone was lying on the ground stunned, all of a sudden Megaera did her grab to Kratos, which I don't think she's even supposed to use again after Tisiphone appears. After winning it, there was a weird slightly sideways camera angle. After a few seconds, Tisiphone got back up and said her usual line about "defeating this mongrel" and phase 2 began properly.

Alternatively, if you ignore Tisiphone entirely and simply deal enough damage to Megaera, this may also force the fight to continue like normal.

Videos:

Other: Tisiphone's final phase mini-game glitch

A similar type of mini-game glitch can be done in the final phase of the Tisiphone fight as well. This time Kratos does the 1st phase mini-game to Tisiphone instead of the finisher QTE. Losing the mini-game drops Megaera out of bounds like usual, but at least the fight won't get stuck afterwards since the game knows you're basically in the last phase of the fight and can continue damaging Tisiphone to bring her back to the finishing mini-game again.

It's also possible to start the finishing QTE after having dropped Megaera out 
of bounds to have the scene slightly glitched up with no Megaera at all. The 
background graphics are also different until the last cutscene of the chapter 
begins.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://youtu.be/6y2EdUdjNqI?t=140


Other: after the fight, it seems inevitable that you have to finish off 
Tisiphone. However, if you press tether and then hold R-stick away from 
Tisiphone, you can in fact miss with your grabs and move past Tisiphone. You 
spared her! Unfortunately you are now softlocked and have to retry.

You can also do a jump or other actions after retrying from last checkpoint. Unfortunately, it seems you can't use tether break-out to escape from this event. Also, even if you displace Kratos, the game positions him back shortly afterwards. Casting magic also doesn't seem to do anything else than a momentary camera angle change.

## Chapter 21 - The Forearm of Apollo

Speed strategy: you don't have to rotate the elevator crank all the way. Just 
rotate it part of the way and then Shield Jump up the elevator. (Hopefully you 
didn't lose the Shield in the last boss fight.)


Speed strategy: you don't have to use the Oath Stone to open up the gate to the 
larger room. Instead, stand on the button as Kratos, then when the grapple 
point is active, jump up to the corner of the room and R1 the grapple point 
through the wall.

Or just Shield Jump repeatedly to get over the doorway, but this way will 
sometimes spawn the enemies in the area too. Not to mention the floor can 
sometimes kill Kratos when you land on it with a Shield attack, so just for 
safety it might be the best to not use this method.

Videos:
1, a speedrun part where this trick is used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDqv61wmIvw#t=1034


World weapon: the enemies in the next fight wield Clubs and Javelins.


Sequence break: you can skip the The Oath Stone of Orkos tutorial fight by 
doing a "slightly higher double jump" followed by Shield Jump. This is just 
enough height to get to the top early. But it's overall more consistent to use 
a Broken Destiny jump instead to do the same thing.


Speed strategy: you can get to the platform you'd have to drag closer by using 
a Shield Jump. Or using Broken Destiny for long jump purposes works almost as 
well.


Speed strategy: you normally get a short cutscene when you complete the puzzle with the angled platform, but this only happens if you leave the Kratos clone to the last third of the platform. If you leave the clone slightly closer to the center of the platform, you open up the exit but avoid watching the cutscene.


World weapon: a Javelin is lying near the big broken chain.


Wasted potential: the fire elevator is not loaded at all if you try to access it before doing the fight at the yard with, f.e. an Upgrade Jump.


Other: if you mess up fixing the chain by letting go of L2 too early, sometimes 
the chain glitches up and becomes unfixable. The hotspot where Amulet responds 
to the chain disappears and you have no choice but to retry from last 
checkpoint.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBn2FdCc6eg#t=55


Other: sometimes the collisions of the chain glitch up after you've fixed it 
and Kratos sinks inside it instead of being able to use it as a platform. If 
this happens, you have to break and fix the chain again - sometimes this makes 
things fine again.


Other: a myriad of extra chain puzzle glitches can occur if you break out of 
the chain's grapple using Rage and Item and then leave the shadow clone to hold 
chain too far away. This basically makes the game confused about what state the 
chain is actually in.

If you leave the clone to hold the chain too far away, then just activate the 
chain with amulet and let go of it, the chain breaks and returns to normal with 
a potentially jerky looking animation. Afterwards, there is mysterious 
collision in the way of the chain, making it harder to latch onto the chain a 
2nd time. The collision will also prevent you from moving the chain unless you 
do another grapple switch break-out.

If you leave the clone to hold the chain too far away, but then attempt to fix 
the chain to the next level, you'll soon find that the chain will collapse 
after fixed. It can't be used as a platform, and it can neither be tethered 
again or fixed again, so the puzzle can't be solved after this. There is 
actually an invisible piece of chain you could latch onto here if there wasn't 
all this collision in the way.

Finally, if you leave the clone to hold the chain too far away and then 
entirely fix the chain, you get a variation where the chain looks intact but it 
can still be tethered onto with R1. Kratos can pull an invisible chain, and 
finally leave a clone to hold the invisible chain and "fix" the chain all over 
again. After that the chain starts working like normal again.

Some of these glitches can maybe happen without leaving a shadow clone far 
away, but that is at least one guaranteed way to start this glitch.

Sequence break: it's possible to do a small sequence break and avoid fixing the chain.

There are two ways to do this without expending an Upgrade Jump. First is to drag the other end of the chain so that it meets the other end. Use Oath Stone to have a shadow Kratos hold the chain in that position. Then do a Shield Jump on top of the right half of the chain and then a continuous Shield Jump to get well on top of the wooden platform in the background. Then choose to let go of the chain again. Now Kratos should be behind the invisible wall of the chain and can continue even without healing the chain. But this is barely faster (and a lot riskier) than doing it normally.

The newer method simply involves dragging the chain for a few seconds, then having a Kratos clone hold it in place. Pulling the chain a little bit changes the nearby collision, allowing you to do two Shield Jumps and reach a wooden platform nearby. The invisible wall all around Kratos seems really high, but much of it is actually the building's own collision, and the invisible wall at the area where it really matters - in front of the doorway to the elevator - is less high than you'd think. If you do a double jump and aim for the doorway itself, with enough height you can get over. Not too hard to pull off in speedruns.

2, AKheon's older vid of the small timesave:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y41_PzqCNJ8


Wasted potential: there is some walkable collision underneath the fire elevator. You can access it by doing a Shield Jump from either side of the doorway, although it's generally pretty difficult. Especially when jumping from the left side, you have to start the jump from on top of the square-shaped block, then double jump into Shield Jump followed by a smooth 180 degree turn so that Kratos lands back where he came from, this time outside bounds.

Unfortunately it seems it's not possible to skip the intro to the fire elevator from out of bounds like this since the trigger for intro fills the entire elevator. I tried high jumping back inside from the other side of the elevator, but still activated the intro.

Furthermore, placing Kratos on top of one of the buttons during the cutscene isn't helpful, since it seems that the elevator cannot move while time is stopped. All of this means that it's unlikely that the elevator intro cutscene could be skipped, at least without some outlandish levitation right to the higher area which skips the elevator altogether.

Videos:

	https://youtu.be/gcvzLQdUcC0?t=21


Other: for a stylish and handy way to ride the fire elevator to the top, you 
can set a shadow Kratos on one of the buttons of the elevator, then run out of 
the exit. Wait for the elevator to rise up a bit, then hang onto its ledge. Now 
you can safely hang onto the ledge for a good part of the journey without 
having to bother with enemies or the fire at all.

Videos:

Sequence break: you can get out of the 2nd fire elevator ride without killing 
any enemies by jumping through the fight barrier's right side at a certain 
angle. Simple yet efficient!


## Chapter 22 - The Ribs of Apollo

Sequence break: you can skip some climbing by doing a long jump to the 
background. A Shield Discard Jump or continuous Shield Jumps should do for this 
purpose. Just remember to grasp onto the grapple point down below after having 
travelled long enough.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZWanwL3n3o


Sequence break: a more advanced version of this skip is to jump directly to the 
platforms you'd normally end up after the climbing part. It's possible since 
they're actually on the same side of the level than where you start from. The 
best way I've found to do this is to use a Shield Discard jump from a LAM 
momentum from the first grapple point up ahead, then at the top of the jump do 
Unarmed Jump continuously. If your aim was good, you're now at the end of the 
chapter.

But that's not all. Now you lack a loading trigger, so you need to go fetch it 
from downstairs. Jump to the direction you would normally enter this area from 
(yes, on top of the chasm) and then back again, this hits the trigger. Then you 
will need a new Shield to do high jumps again, so you need to start the fight 
before entering The Furnace and fetch a Shield from the small Satyr there. 
Don't use Oath Stone for knocking a Shield off the Satyr's hands because this 
can crash the game when entering deeper into the Furnace. All in all, this skip 
should save around 25 secs.

Other: there is a small invisible floor below the mid-point of the last climb 
before making to the next set of grapple points. You can carefully get onto it 
with a Shield Jump, but so far there isn't much use from this knowledge. Hard 
to reach anywhere useful from here with all the death collision nearby.

World weapon: after the platforming, you come upon an abandoned Club. The enemies in the fight can also drop Shield.


Sequence break: you can skip the Satyr General fight by doing a Shield Jump 
from atop the nearby box.

Alternatively, and faster, you can do continuous Unarmed Jump from the higher 
platforms, sticking to the right-hand wall. If done right, Kratos ends up out 
of bounds on the Satyr General fight platform and can just slip past the fight 
boundary from there. Picking up a Shield from the enemies is still possible 
even if Kratos is already past the fight barrier.

Other: sometimes you can have one of the larger Satyrs to spawn on the wrong 
side of the fight barrier.


Speed strategy: The piece you push in the upcoming corridor can also be Shield Jumped over. However, don't cut too many corners by jumping outside the corridor or you may accidentally miss the loading trigger for The Furnace itself.

## Chapter 23 - The Furnace

Sequence break / wasted potential: you can enter The Furnace from out of bounds 
with repeated Shield Jumps from on top of the second piece you'd push out of 
the way. But doing this seems to be less useful than you'd hope, because the 
switch to pour oil on top of the coal pot is never unsealed until you fight the 
Cyclops fight.

This trick should be tested a bit more. For now it seems necessary to fight the 
Furnace fight and see the intro cutscene sooner or later because otherwise you 
can't complete the Furnace puzzle. Or am I missing something here? Could this 
actually be a nice sequence break?

Videos:
1, a part of a speedrun where this trick is seemingly used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDqv61wmIvw#t=1166


World weapon: there's a Sword in the middle of the main area.


Speed strategy: one of the fastest ways to complete this fight is to hit all 
the required Manticore eggs to activate the flying enemies, then group them all 
together close to the Cyclops and cast Ice Magic twice. This shatters all 
flying enemies and freezes the Cyclops, and it's very easy to shatter him after 
that.

Speed strategy: you can get around the bars leading to the left area by Shield 
Jumping there. Go to the back and left and jump over the chasm and around the 
wall to reach the other side. Simple as that!

Videos:

Other: if you do things in wrong order here, you can have the Cyclops hit 
Kratos as he is turning the wheel that creates sparks. This causes the sparks 
to shoot out of the machine forever, and you might become stuck, unable to 
complete the puzzle. (c: findlestick)

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=73


Speed strategy: you can reach the area at the back without using the moving 
platform. You have to start by doing a Shield Jump from the left side of the 
wheel you'd normally turn at this point. This is to go over a small invisible 
wall. Then do another Shield Jump to get on top of the wheel. And from there a 
continuous Shield Jump is enough to reach the other side.


Speed strategy (NG+): if you leave some of the Manticore eggs intact, you can 
use them to move the coal pedestal around with the Ice Rage glitch, saving 
time. However, it's not recommended to use more than one Ice Rage in a RTA, 
because otherwise there is a chance the game will crash.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL8_rm2d7Mo


Other: for unknown reasons, maybe for using Ice Rage glitch in a certain way, 
the coal pedestal can glitch up. Only the coal remains and it is floating in 
air. The pedestal also can't be moved any longer after this! In Robin Fleming's 
example below, the coal pedestal was positioned beneath the right-most part of 
the machine and could still be lit on fire using the Amulet, even though it was 
glitched up.

Wasted potential: using an Upgrade jump you can reach inside the exit elevator 
before lighting up the Furnace. The elevator starts rising, but it never 
delivers Kratos to the next map, causing him to get stuck.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5haAFn9L8Ig#t=103


World weapon: after lighting up The Furnace and walking back to the main hall, 
some Sling enemies will spawn.


Sequence break: you can skip the fight after lighting up The Furnace by (again) 
going over the gap using Shield Jumps.

An alternative is to jump through the ceiling of the room to get back upstairs, 
if you can spare an upgrade for that purpose. Broken Destiny jump that gets 
extra height from a reset in air or an Upgrade Jump (with hover) is also enough 
for this job. You can also try to do a simple Combined Tactics Jump if you feel 
lucky.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UCJQ0xXt6g


Speed strategy: you can skip using the grapple point and climbing for a short 
while by doing a Shield Jump up to the conveyor belt.


Sequence break: skip conveyor belt fight

If you do an Upgrade Jump, Broken Destiny jump or a slightly higher double jump 
-> Shield Jump, Kratos is able to get enough height at the back end of the 
conveyor belt to be able to grasp onto the grapple point above early.

Videos:

World weapon: a Sword can be acquired in the conveyor belt fight.


## Chapter 24 - The Shoulder of Apollo

World weapon: enemies with Shields, Swords, Clubs and Slings spawn at the start 
of the level.


Other: if you high jump outside the fight arena to the direction where you came from, the grapple point there still exists. Using it makes Kratos leap back into the fighting arena and then get stuck in place forever.


Sequence break: you can skip fixing the chain after the fight if you just 
Shield Jump to the upper level. The footing is a bit slippery, but with a 
certain angle you'll make it. However, you must do this after the fight or else 
there is nothing loaded beyond.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9RlQqlAak#t=175


Speed strategy: you can save a little bit of time during the upcoming slide by using one of the several slide-related glitches that give you extra speed.

The original method involved doing Poseidon Tremble speed glitch to skip a short stretch of the slide, and it's just as risky as it sounds. My recommendation is to aim L-stick to the right just a little bit while doing Blades air attacks after gaining superspeed. Kratos is aligned with the path for a moment doing this, and then you can land back on it by using a move like Poseidon Tremble again - something that sends Kratos down without the influence of superspeed. If done correctly, you end up back on the path a short way before the grapple point, and you save 15 seconds.

The newer and safer method involves getting a speed boost from the Shield o1 done into the slide. If you do this attack from a correct distance to the slide, Kratos flies for a second or two over the slide with an elevated speed. During this time, you can double jump and go totally off rails and fly a surprising distance with consecutive Shield Jump. This is much safer to do than the first method since your speed is more manageable.

The death collision acts a bit weird during this stretch of corridor, so especially with the second method it's safer to stay outside the slide rather than inside it. A loading trigger has to be hit in the part of the slide right before the last grapple point. Going any further than that with either of these two tricks results in The Furnace not loading and Kratos falling off-camera to his doom once you jump down the chute.

To note, latching onto the grapple point ahead with superspeed causes a mysterious game over.

## Chapter 25 - The Furnace

Random: although you're no longer supposed to be able to access it, the upper floor of The Furnace still exists. It still has the chests that you could find from there in Chapter 23, but the grapple switch and the wall prompt no longer exist. The elevator is open to access and has no triggers. Entering it just makes Kratos fall back down to the lower level again. If you go to the small walkway at the back of The Furnace, it doesn't have an unique camera angle and the level graphics will go invisible from time to time.


Speed strategy: if you play straight from Chapter 24 without retries, you should have the super magnetic ledge-effect active. You can zip right into the upper floor by doing Poseidon Tremble (air) to behind Kratos right after he has landed, and from here you can jump past the locked gate without opening it for a few seconds time save.


Other: this set piece consists of three different parts: the lower floor, the map of the upper area that features both the pit stop in the middle as well as the top floor, as well as the elevator carrying Kratos through all these tiers. The trigger which unloads the lower floor while also loading the higher area exists in the general vicinity of the elevator shaft at the correct height. It seems the exit is functional and you could reach it to escape this set piece early IF you could just get enough height without having to use the elevator, although this is quite a tall order.

Using the magnetic ledges glitch, it's possible to get as high as the pit stop without using the elevator in more than one way: you could either use a series of ledges to climb the shaft that you previously used to enter Chapter 24 and then do a large high jump to end up inside the pit stop shaft. There's a cylindrical layer of floor there that can be stood on. However, since you're not close enough to the elevator set piece, the upper area never loads. Distance also makes it hard to cross over to the elevator area from here properly. You can also touch a magnetic ledge on the grapple switch itself to zip directly to the mid-stop - then get on top with a precise Poseidon Tremble into Ice Rage. A part of the mid-stop floor exists even without the elevator around.


World weapon: during the first part of the elevator ride, you can get Sword from enemies. You can also see enemies carrying Slings, but they apparently cannot drop them.


Random: if you use an attack with a knockback against the Hounds, they 
sometimes fly through the flames without dying. But this is enough to start the 
elevator rising sequence.


Speed strategy: you can lure the Talos enemy to jump into the flames during its 
leaping attack.


Speed strategy: you can stun the Satyrs by parrying their attacks, then throw 
them quickly into the flames. Fire Rage is another quick way to stun the 
enemies.


Other: at the mid-way stop, you can cause a small glitch by first pulling the 
grapple switch all the way and let it be held down by a shadow Kratos, then 
going to the large wheel and doing L2+triangle in air in front of it just 
before landing to cut the animation short. You have a very short time to 
examine the wheel with R1 before the lid becomes closed. So now Kratos turns 
the wheel while being phased inside the lid.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qDtOhCn61I#t=166


Other: you can cause some minor glitches here using a grapple switch break-out. 
One interesting thing you can do is to leave a shadow clone on top of the 
chest, then open the chest. Opening the chest severs the connection between the 
clone and the grapple switch for some reason!

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/mpXQ6DrhRFI?t=283


Other: for some reason the fire in the center of the elevator can shut down 
early and it becomes impossible to complete this section.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tminud8b8Yc


World weapon: during the second part of elevator ride, you can get Sword from 
enemies.


Speed strategy: if you hadn't retried from last checkpoint since Chapter 24, 
you are in a special mode where ledge magnetism acts in a extra powerful way. 
In this case you can use Tremble ledge magnetism to climb on top of the tall 
wall of the elevator and jump inside even if all enemies are not dead yet. Just 
be careful with your jump: if it's too short, Kratos will get stuck on 
something and you have to retry.

Sometimes it's simply faster to kill the enemies normally since this also 
speeds up the loading of the next area, but it never hurts to have 
alternatives.


## Chapter 26 - Eyes of Apollo

Speed strategy: after riding the elevator to the top floor, Shield Run to keep 
moving during the scenic cutscene.


World weapon: a lone Club is sitting in the corner of the bottom floor.


Other: in general Eyes of Apollo is a somehow glitchy map. Loading this Chapter from the menu again gives Kratos hyper ledge magnetism, allowing him to grab onto high ledges almost everywhere on the map. But retrying just once, this ability is lost, so keep that in mind.

Also, I've noticed that sometimes if you quit game as you do Poseidon Tremble here, the game will crash.


Other: GMG notes that retrying inside the Wraith-fight can cause the following to happen: "With restart, you can get a glitched Wraith who has ~13.5HP (goes to red halo with ~9HP remaining). Being hit by one slap of the Ice spell sends it to red halo (very clearly a glitch). The non-summoned ones that spawn-in are fine."


Other: one of the sillier ledge magnetism spots in this map is inside the glass 
cube. You are able to zip Kratos inside it so that only his head and arms pop 
out. Pressing circle to drop down is fatal, since there is some death collision 
at the bottom of the glass... Kratos also dies if he is standing under the 
glass cube as it is lowered down, which looks humorous.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9RlQqlAak#t=381


Speed strategy: completing the puzzle fast (version 1)

It's possible to skip large parts of the Eyes puzzle and solve it under a 
minute. First of all, you don't need the block to get out of the pit you start 
in if you have Shield since you can just Shield Jump out. So do that. Then you 
might as well pull the switch on the very left to lower the beam, because you 
have to do this sooner or later. After that, go back on top of the glass cube 
and push the block off the cube. Now, the interesting part of this strategy...

Jump on the spot on top of the cube so that it starts rising. Do Broken Destiny 
to stay in air for long enough for the game to think that the block is rising 
up unhindered and that the ensuing cutscene starts. Then, when the cutscene is 
close to over, retry from last checkpoint. As the game continues, the block is 
rising up... but so is Kratos with it! This is a fast trip upstairs.

Run a little ways into the conveyor belt, leave a Kratos clone, then solve the 
remaining puzzle as normal. Easy peasy!

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpXlliLotg
 

Speed strategy: completing the puzzle fast (version 2)

Later an even faster alternative way to solve the puzzle was discovered. First 
push the block off the glass cube but leave a Kratos clone behind you to 
prevent the block from rising up. Then climb up the ladder, get to the conveyor 
belt and leave a new Kratos clone on it. Next, make your way up to the switch 
to the left... it doesn't matter which way you go, as long as you don't land on 
the glass cube or else a cutscene will start. Now you can multitask and pull 
the switch and set everything else up while the clone is on its way, saving 
some extra seconds in the process.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW_MrMhkr6s


Speed strategy: aside the previous ideas, it is possible to use Poseidon 
Tremble under some strategic ledges to skip climbing. You can get to the 
conveyor belt in one second by doing a Tremble close to the glass cube - a 
little to the right and down from it, aiming the Tremble downwards. Or another 
way to get to the conveyor belt fast is to do a Tremble close to the ladder 
(aiming away from it) to grasp onto the ledge right above.

Finally, after solving the puzzle you can use Tremble to skip a part of the 
ladder climb. Try doing a Tremble towards right when standing next to the chain 
you had to pull during the puzzle. There is a strange ledge far above, and with 
double jumps you can get to the top of the first part of the ladder in two 
seconds or so. The worst part about all these Trembles is that they're not 
always 100% reliable to do, so they probably aren't worth it to do in a RTA. 
(c: Robin Fleming)


Sequence break: no matter how you solve the puzzle, you never have to fight the 
Wraiths and other enemies down in the pit. As long as you can high jump just a 
little...


Wasted potential: you can skip the entire puzzle using an Upgrade Jump, but the 
game will freeze during the next cutscene.


## Chapter 27 - The Lantern of Delos

Other: pressing R1 during the cutscene transition into this chapter, Kratos 
breaks out of the small Manticore pre-fight cutscene. He doesn't fall from 
above along with Manticore - instead he starts off standing on ground in his 
angry idle stance. Looks somewhat comical, although it doesn't save time.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1WrF70NW7k#t=277


Other: the Manticore fight can glitch up in a game breaking way. There is no 
music in the fight, camera is fixed to a strange position... and worst of all, 
once you've killed the Manticore, the gate blocking the exit does not lower. So 
you're stuck if this happens. Even if you manage to high jump over the gate, no
new cutscene begin nor will the Chapter 28 area be loaded at this stage.

The glitch seems to start if you retry from this checkpoint, so you should do your best to ensure that never happens. Don't quit playing at this point of the game or die during the fight.

Note: this glitch has been patched, so if you updated Ascension, this is 
something you don't have to worry about.


Wasted potential: you can get over the gate and skip fighting Manticore with a 
high enough jump... but you can't progress in the level before having dealt 
with the beast. Even if you jump over all the obstacles, the Chapter 28 area is
simply not loaded as of yet.

The door at the foreground, which cannot be seen during the fight, is blocked by a tall and thick invisible wall as well. It's unknown if the door could be activated if you could somehow bore through this invisible wall to get to the door early.


Speed strategy: you can Shield Run into the next cutscene after having killed 
the Manticore to save a few seconds. As a glitchy bonus, this moves the 
location of the next checkpoint too a little, so that it starts right before 
the pre-rendered cutscene.


Other: sometimes the music of the Manticore fight will get stuck even after 
beating it. The fight music goes on until you go open the left door for the 
first time.


Other: you can break out of the story cutscene that takes place shortly after 
the Manticore fight by using passive tether into it. Kratos stands idly by as 
the cutscene progresses and no dialogue is heard. Other than that, things work 
out like normal.

You can also break-out of the 2nd part of the cutscene by pressing X and R1 at 
the same time after skipping the pre-rendered cinematic.

2, AKheon's vid of glitching 2nd part of the cinematic:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqOMKOW6szA#t=214


Wasted potential: you can try to do a high jump to the Trials of Archimedes 
chapter before turning the lens to its right place, but nothing is loaded 
there. Nothing is also loaded beneath this area (except one stray chest), so 
you can't go to the end of Chapter 28 early either.


## Chapter 28 - Trial of Archimedes

Other: in this level there are two areas, right and left side, that Kratos is 
only supposed to move between using the portal. If Kratos goes around the 
portal using high jumps, some strange things happen as a result.

If you're on the left side without the game being ready for it, the graphics in 
the background are glitched up until you approach the left doors since a 
loading trigger is there. Also, trying to open the left doors causes Kratos to 
become stuck in the animation for all eternity! If you try to return to the 
right side after having been to the left doors, Kratos falls out of bounds 
since the right area does not exist at the moment.

If you're on the right side without the game being ready for it, trying to open 
the right doors causes a really bizarre effect where Kratos appears in unloaded 
nothingness and you get the cinematic that you normally see at the end of 
Chapter 28! However, this doesn't seem to mean anything and afterwards Kratos 
continues falling in unloaded nothingness, eventually getting killed.

Videos:

2, AKheon's vid that has the listed left side variations and more:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhX2VGGQu28


Wasted potential: upgrade break-outs in this area can't be utilized in any 
meaningful way. Even if Kratos has broken out of some action, time is stopped 
and you can't do anything else during this time.


Wasted potential: you can't jump inside the cage to get Eyes of Truth early 
from underneath because the floor is solid!


Other / speed strategy: when opening the right doors for the first time, you 
get two cutscenes in a row. Between the cutscenes there is a frame of time 
during which you can *close* the doors while the game is still reacting to them 
being opened the first time, causing some strange stuff to happen.

The most obvious effect is that Kratos regains movement early during the door 
opening cutscene. With the doors still closed, though, there is little to do 
than marvel at the cinematic camera angles until the cutscene ends.

If you re-open the right doors while the cutscene is still playing, you are 
able to go and fetch the Eyes of Truth during it, and... yes! This is actually 
a speed tactic that cuts some 10 seconds off the boring cutscene. You also 
regain movement during the elevator ride down, allowing you to multitask by 
shooting the elevator switch with Eyes of Truth early. The worst part is that 
this trick is indeed frame precise, and there's no guarantee of being able to 
do it in a RTA. At least it doesn't waste time to try.

Escaping the elevator ride is possible. If you close the right doors while the 
platform is down, you cause a glitchy switch to appear where the cage should 
be. You can Eyes of Truth it, but cannot access and turn it at this state.

Escaping back to the first area, its graphics are currently glitched. If you 
return, the Eyes of Truth have materialized back inside the invisible floating 
cage. You cannot retrieve them like this, and you are stuck since you can't 
begin the Trial either!

One drawback of using Eyes of Truth to the elevator early is that sometimes the 
switch glitches up and can't be activated. The game thinks that the Fury 
Barrier is still blocking the switch, although it is invisible. But you can fix 
this by shooting the switch with Eyes one extra time.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpRn9aP9VFE#t=47


Speed strategy: if you use Eyes of Truth to the elevator switch in air, you skip the 3-second filler cutscene before you can use the switch. Should be an useful little tip for saving time if you have to retry here a lot...


Other: if you still have hyper responsive ledge magnetism, beware: don't do 
Falling Helios too much during the Trials of Archimedes fights. Otherwise 
Kratos has the danger of falling through the seams of the fight arena to his 
death, ruining your progress.

Don't try to escape the fights early either by climbing on top of the risen 
parts of the platform either. Stray pieces of death collision can catch you 
doing that!


Fight exploit: staying near the edges of the arena can sometimes make the
Gorgons or other enemies completely passive, allowing you to pick them off with
Oath Stone from afar.


Fight exploit?: during the 2nd fight of the gauntlet, the Talos-enemy can sometimes die by itself if he is too close to the arena boundary. I haven't tested if this could be used as a consistent speed tactic during the fight.

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/HxMGUpxNZi4?t=247


Other: after beating all three fights but before lifting the elevator up to the 
top floor, walking to the sides of the arena hurts Kratos as if there were some 
spikes still there.


Speed strategy: you don't have to rotate the lens apparatus all the way to the 
correct position. It can be slightly skewed and the game still counts the 
puzzle as being completed.


Other: if you use the Eyes of Truth or do some other attacks while going in 
through the doorway to the other side, the Eyes on Kratos' hands in the 
cutscene are invisible.


Other / wasted potential: if you beat the Trial while the game thinks you're on 
the left half of the area, upon closing the right doors again the cage will not 
close. You can't rotate the switch right now, and thus can't complete the 
puzzle of the area like this.


Other: if you dissipate shadow Kratos that is holding the crank right before 
entering the portal to the other side after solving the puzzle, the game enters 
a glitched state where you've half-won the level. You get the "puzzle failure" 
cutscene, but afterwards Kratos still doesn't lose his Eyes of Truth. The inky 
Fury barrier also doesn't appear behind him after passing to the other side, 
unlike normal.

So what to do now? If you go to the left doorway, Kratos becomes stuck 
struggling to open it. The animation of opening the door never ends and you 
just get stuck. Also, if you visit the left door and try to return to the right 
side, it has most likely unloaded, causing Kratos to fall to his death... too 
bad you can't skip to the lower floor early doing this, though.

If you manage to return to the right side, you can cause other strange 
reactions like picking up two sets of Eyes of Truth. Unfortunately doing this 
will cause the crank of the cage to glitch up - after this point Kratos will 
only grab an invisible "crank" that does not actually align the lenses at all. 
So you get stuck. It's also possible to make Eyes of Truth disappear entirely 
from both Kratos' inventory and the level before completing the puzzle, making 
the game truly unwinnable.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhX2VGGQu28


Wasted potential: it seems you can't tether break out of the cutscene that 
starts after beating the Trial puzzle and walking through the portal.


Other: with a break-out, Kratos can regain movement after opening the last set 
of doors and completely prevent the final set of cutscenes of this chapter from 
starting. During this time, you can try to go and pick up Eyes of Truth from 
inside the cage, even though you're never supposed to do that in this part of 
the map. Kratos' animation is displaced in a strange way, after which the eyes 
float in air for a moment... and this can be done repeatedly. Not useful, it 
seems, but looks pretty fun. You can also close the doors, but that does 
absolutely nothing. You're stuck, and have to retry to continue.

Other: it seems that if you frame precisely cast a stray magic during the 
loading transition to The Fury Citadel, Kratos can become frozen and refuses to 
move afterwards. You also don't get a new checkpoint, forcing you to start over 
from the previous chapter before all the long cutscenes.

## Chapter 29 - The Fury Citadel

Sequence break: you can skip the section where you have to pull the grapple 
switch to activate a grapple point, saving something like 20 seconds. There are 
two ways to go about doing this:

The crazier, riskier way is to jam Kratos between the wall and the grapple 
switch. Pull the grapple switch away from the wall a little way, hold it down 
with a shadow Kratos, get Kratos in the right position and let go of the 
grapple switch... Kratos may get pushed through the wall. Doing rolls towards 
the wall at this time also seems necessary to have enough speed to go through. 
(c: AKheon)

Or for a more reliable way, use a LAM / Broken Destiny type of jump to get 
enough height to go over the wall.

The best way, if you've played directly from Chapter 26 without a retry, is 
doing Poseidon Tremble ledge magnetism towards the right side of the far wall. 
This will lift Kratos up to the top of the wall and you can jump over it from 
there.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gP8sleiBqQ


Wasted potential: you can R1 the exit door before beating the two Empusas, but 
nothing happens afterwards. Screen stays black and you are stuck. In other 
words, the Empusa fight can't be skipped.


Other: you can Shield Jump back to the other side of the closed gate to use the grapple point again, but this is a bad idea: using the grapple point a 2nd time, you just end up getting stuck on it forever.


Wasted potential: you can break out of the R1-prompt of the large door. This makes the doors open up by themselves before the big cutscene begins. Like the long cutscene at Chapter 4, the playable Kratos is teleported somewhere off-camera during this time. However, since time is stopped, breaking out or doing any other actions doesn't seem to be too useful. There's nothing very glitchy you can do in the vicinity before the cutscene begins. It's possible to R1 the door more than once, but this also doesn't seem to do much.


Wasted potential: you can frame precisely cast magic at the last checkpoint 
before Alecto's Chamber. But all this does is cause a short graphical effect - 
no break-out seems to be possible.


## Chapter 30 - Alecto's Chamber

Other / speed strategy: Cutscene break-out

You can do a temporary break-out when entering the first cutscene of this chapter with passive tether. After you fall into the cutscene, Kratos is able to do one attack after landing down. For instance, you can cast some magic to glitch up the camera. Doing this or any other unnecessary attacks changes Kratos' walking angle for the next part, and as a side effect, he may accidentally miss Alecto during his dramatic walk and fall out of bounds instead.

You can use Shield Run after the break-out to have Kratos keep move all the way to Alecto during the cutscene. If your angle was right, you'll hit the Eyes of Truth trigger and next checkpoint within seconds while the first cutscene is still playing. Using Eyes of Truth now doesn't seem to work - however, retrying from the last checkpoint, Kratos finds himself at the checkpoint right before using Eyes of Truth, Tisiphone is absent and Alecto is hanging out in a t-pose. Using Eyes of Truth makes the game continue normally from this point on, and it can be used as a speedrun strategy to save 10-15 seconds. The worst part is that since you're so fast, sometimes the next checkpoint doesn't have time to load, which means that when you try to retry, you end up back at the start of Chapter 30 and end up wasting a lot of time instead.

For a more consistent and safe time save, simply jump into the cutscene doing passive tether and sprint after landing. Kratos moves a pretty good distance while time is stopped thanks to the sprint, allowing him to cinematically walk to the Eyes of Truth-trigger almost 10 seconds faster than normal once he regains control. As a side effect of doing this, the checkpoint that would normally activate at the Eyes of Truth-trigger instead activates at the start of the next cutscene at the raging sea, but so far this doesn't seem to cause any side effects to occur.

Wasted potential: it's not possible to break out of the using Eyes of Truth-
checkpoint using magic.


Other: rarely if you cast magic as the game transitions into the stormy sea 
section, you get a softlock where the HUD appears and the camera shows a 
picture of the sea where nothing is going on. You seemingly can't control 
Kratos at the moment, and have to retry.

Other: during the first fight, if Daimon starts throwing Kratos at the same 
time the cutscene of tentacles throwing ships around starts, you'll see Kratos 
being thrown at first before he disappears mid-air. Then the following cutscene 
cuts short as the game over screen appears.

Other: rarely a cruel bug can happen here where Kratos falls out of bounds during the cutscene after beating the first tentacle. This causes him to not only die but also become checkpointed out of bounds, meaning that it is impossible to continue playing from that point. Have to retry the Chapter from beginning!

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/zaoG_RH6uDY?t=374


Wasted potential: in the part where you have to fight two tentacles that are 
wrapped around the ship, you can high jump over the first tentacle to get to 
the end of the ship early. Unfortunately nothing interesting can be done here, 
other than camera becoming glitched. To note, if you mini-game the tentacle
from the wrong side, Kratos just phases through to the correct side.


Other: spamming Eyes of Truth causes the tentacle Fury Barrier to act 
strangely. It rejuvenates almost instantly if you make it vanish.

Other: detaching from the tentacle slide

When Kratos starts sliding on the big tentacle, retrying from last checkpoint 
and spamming X can cause Kratos to begin the checkpoint in air. So he 
effectively breaks free of the autoscrolling sliding section.

Kratos' movement is limited at the moment, but you can start adjust your position in air a little bit with Shield air attacks or by holding down L2 and pushing L-stick. Staying close to the tentacle from where you start from and going a little bit to the right, you can land on a walkable part of the next tentacle - although it's still invisible at this point. From here, it's possible to do Poseidon Tremble speed glitch, but it's hard to go anywhere from here because of insta-death collision.

Falling past the tentacle and into the water allows you to see out of bounds for a moment. There's some walkable collision near the water level as well, although it's hard to find and doesn't seem to serve much purpose.

It turns out that you can also detach from the tentacle without retrying from 
last checkpoint by spamming X very fast when the part begins for the first 
time. I only did it once, but as a result the upcoming tentacles are not loaded 
at all. They start off invisible, they remain invisible, and at the end of the 
ride Kratos can't save himself because the upcoming grapple points do not 
exist.

2, AKheon's vid of the last scenario:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqPhrur6O00


Other: the death collision of the water is unique and you can open up menus as 
the game over screen is timed to appear on screen. This allows some unique side 
results, like crashing the game or finishing the game while Start-menu is open and
blocking your view.

Wasted potential: it seems it's not possible to break out from the underwater section using a passive tether.


Other: you are able to do attacks for a short moment at the end of the 
underwater section. Doing magics causes Kratos to land on the upcoming fight 
arena early, which looks strange. But after the magic is over, the normal 
cutscenes will continue and everything goes back to normal.

Well, it is a speed strategy of sort on NG+ to cast Soul Rage during this time 
since the final boss is very vulnerable to souls and they do in fact keep 
hitting it during the cutscene. It has not been timed, but this should save 
some time.


World weapon: there's a Javelin in the final boss arena.


Other / Speed Strategy: casting Soul Rage has a strange effect in this fight. 
The souls will target some invisible target at the back-left of the fight 
arena, hovering around it and causing a lot of hits. This actually damages the 
boss itself, and on NG+ you'll finish this boss in no time by just doing Soul
Rage over and over again.

The other homing Soul-element attack L1+t also homes in on this target, but seemingly doesn't cause hits or damage.


Other: I once had a strange glitch here where screen prompts and subtitles 
became disabled at the final checkpoint of the game. It would be kind of 
difficult the play the game through like this, considering you don't see what 
button you have to press during the QTEs!

Other: you can break-out of the scene where Kratos finishes off the furies by tapping X -> L1 when retrying from its cutscene. This lets you run freely on the bit of boss arena where Alecto is lying wounded. The trigger for starting the Tisiphone cutscene is in the center of the arena, and you can just run around it to get to Alecto early. Unfortunately this Alecto is just a prop and cannot really be interacted with in any way, even if Soul Rage does attempt to target her.

If you approach the Tisiphone cutscene in air or from a wrong angle, it will play with a different altitude and angle, allowing you to see some half-unloaded scenery. It looks glitchy, especially since you can see Tisiphone's alternative character models hanging out off-camera, but otherwise things work normal. Kratos' position is returned to normal upon the neck snap of the old lady. Since this cutscene doesn't seem to mind gravity, it's not possible to break out of it by using passive tether, which limits the possibilities of this event glitch.

The walls of the boss arena are outrageously high, and even if you could get across, it seems there isn't really anywhere to go from here. So no skipping right to the final prompt of the game early, it seems.

Other: you can break-out of the ending cutscene! First opportunity to do this 
is after the cinematic where Alecto's Chamber explodes. Spamming R1+X may cause 
Kratos to stand idly in the middle of the road when the game shows you Kratos' 
house. But this break-out is pretty harmless and fixes itself soon.

Another break-out opportunity is after the cinematic cutscene where Kratos' 
family is slain. This causes the camera to become very skewed so that you can't 
see anything of the ending happening. There is also no narration, so it's a 
very anti-climactic, bizarre ending like this.
