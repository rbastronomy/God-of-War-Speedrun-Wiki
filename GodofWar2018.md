## **Gliches & Tricks**




## *Glitches*
![Video](https://github.com/rbastronomy/God-of-War-Speedrun-Wiki/blob/main/videos/helheim-interact-clip.webp)
Helheim Interact mini skip
- This glitch allows you to skip the Helheim Interact climb animation when you're positioned next to the falling stone, it's very consistent and easy to do.

Hel's Touch Runic Attack tutorial glitch. Found by: greembic
- This glitch allows to skip a level for "hel's touch" runic attack by simply grabbing the runic again. After you adquire it you have to restart checkpoint and go back to the chest and grab it again. for very easy the maximum level that you can achieve is level 2 BUT for very hard you'll have to level up first the runic attack to level 2 because when you restart and grab it again it will level up so is recommended to level it up first and then grab it again so it levels up to level 3.



## *Tricks*

Brook's bridge skip
- Brok's bridge skip allows you to skip the dialogue of brok by simply trowing the axe high in the air and walking towards him enabling the "skip cutscene" trigger.

Climbing Sword Skip
- For this particular case the consistency for this trick is unknown but at least is real and possible to replicate just have to aim correctly between the wall and the kick interaction so kratos can climb the wall and skip the sword climbing animation.



## *Bosses*

First Troll Fight (Hardest Difficulty)
- You can use the same strategy as the video above, but you'll have to be more careful with the troll's attacks to dodge correctly and not get hit.





## *Miscellaneous*

Helheim Raven Skip
- A raven skip that you can do in Helheim early in the game instead of going back later to.

Valkyrie Out of Bounds
- Sometimes the valkyries can fly away of the arena and get stuck leaving you in a softlock, sometimes the valkyrie dies too (it's very rare and more common in sigrun's fight)

Helheim Boat Out of Bounds
- If you're close the mini-bridge to unstuck the boat and you're in the right position you can get out of bounds and fall but the consecuence it's that you lose around 3-6 minutes because you'll have to start again the boat travel.

Hraezlyr Bug Fight
- Hraezlyr can send you high in the sky if you're in the right position, so far it's not known if this has any potential to skip this part of the game/fight
