# Introduction
------------------------------------------

Ah, God of War. The games in this series are mostly known for their visceral
combat and high production values, but they also tend to have awfully many
glitches in them. Which is good, in a way.

While having your game freeze is typically not very amusing, in some
circumstances glitches can have a positive value as well. They have an unique
power that can be harnessed for the purposes of speed gaming and entertainment.
Numerous exploits exist that allow the player to skip large sections of the
levels; some glitches also create potential for surreal humor, like Kratos
swimming in air or talking to invisible characters. Join us, as we delve deep
into the quirks of God of War III programming and in the process witness
shocking, glitchy sights.

... in the end, it is ensured that "only Chaos remains."

For the first time, the writing was done co-op thanks to the wonders of modern
technology and real-time collaborative editing services. Eased the workload
quite a lot.

Be mindful that there will be some spoilers! It's only recommended to peruse
this guide after you've finished the game.


Note 1: the bulk of this FAQ was written with the original PS3-version of the
game in mind. However, since God of War III Remastered has come out, we have
tried to account for the differences between the two versions wherever possible.
The Remastered version is mostly a straight port of the original game, but it
does have more glitch potential since some of the more extreme glitches that
caused the PS3-version to crash no longer do so on PS4. If some trick is PS3- or
PS4-specific, it is specifically mentioned in the guide.

Note 2: most of the testing for this guide has been done without any patches.
Things may vary in unseen ways if you have patched your game; for instance, the
New Game+ glitch may no longer work.


Current speedrun records...?

See the leaderboards at speedrun.com for the current list of RTA records.

Abbreviations:

GoW = God of War
GoW II = God of War II
GoW III = God of War III (simple enough)

BoA = Blades of Athena
BoE = Blades of Exile
RoS = Rage of Sparta
HoH = Head of Helios
...and so on.

NG = New Game (or sometimes NP = Normal Play)
NG+ = New Game+ (glitch)

CG = Combat Grapple

A.I. = artificial intelligence

c: = credits to
§ = note to self / does anyone else know better?
* = general note

Glossary:
---------

Launch / Lift-up = An attack capable of launching enemies high up in air. If you
hold down the attack button, you can make Kratos rise up after the enemy as
well.

Bounce = A melee attack effect in which an enemy will bounce a bit after a
successful hit. It's not as high as a launch.

Knockback = A melee attack effect in which the enemy is knocked away.

Downed = An enemy which has fallen on its back/on the ground.


Collision damage = Damage that enemies take from other enemies, for instance if
Kratos throws a smaller enemy at a larger one.

False grab = Kratos' fumbling reaction to trying to grab an enemy that is immune
to being grabbed at the moment. Sometimes you can use a false grab to manipulate
enemy behaviour (like against Gorgons).

Infinite air grab / Orion's Harpoon = some enemies can be air grabbed or Orion's
Harpooned indefinitely, without them being able to escape. The enemy section far
below lists which foes are subjectible to this kind of a cheap but fun strategy.


Out of bounds = Anywhere outside the intended game area.

Sweet spot = a tactical place on the battlefield where your enemies either can't
reach you or due to A.I. limitations won't be of danger.

Break out = Kratos breaks free out of some scene or action. Not as common in
this game as in GoW II, where you could keep moving during some cutscenes by
switching weapons at a correct time, to name an example.



# General glitches & tricks
----------------------------

"New Game +"

As you may know, God of War III doesn't have a New Game+ mode that would allow
the player to start a new game with all weapons and gear at hand. However, in
the unpatched versions of the game you can accomplish the same thing using a
glitch.

You need Combat Arena to do this, so beat the game once, then beat all the
Challenges to unlock the Arena, and then...


Step-by-step instructions:

1. Load the Combat Arena and set difficulty to God or Titan.

2. Die enough times to be offered the "switch to easy" option.

3. Select either "Yes" or "No". This will take you back to the Main Menu. You
will get the Maxed Out Trophy at this point if you didn't have it already.

4. Start "New Game". You can select any difficulty to play your New Game+ on,
even Chaos, even if you have only beaten Normal yet.

5. You will have all the weapons when you start on Gaia and will be all Maxed
Out. Blades of Exile will be at Lv. 1 when you get them later on, though.


Infinite health glitch:

You can also give Kratos infinite health from the Arena options and it will
carry into the main game. This will cause him to never take damage from enemy
attacks and he also becomes immune to most death collisions - which means that
you can fall into a bottomless pit and survive. The only way Kratos can die is
getting petrified in the air, so you want to have some Gorgons as your enemies
in the Arena when setting up the glitch.

You can also put magic and item gauges to infinite from the Arena options, but
those values are not guaranteed to stay with you when you begin the new game. It
does occasionally happen, though.

Videos:
1, n3obuddha's tutorial of the NG+ glitch:
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REwJhKZs9h4


Other notes about NG+:

- If you kill Kratos too fast while setting up the NG+ glitch (f.e by using
Hermes Boots in air to quickly smash Kratos to the ground as he is being
petrified) will start the game with all weapons at Level 1, except for the
Blades of Athena which will (always?) start fully-upgraded. So that’s another
option you might consider for your playthrough.

- After starting NG+, the glitch will remain in the background until the next
time you enter normal gameplay, whether it be the Combat Arena, Challenges or
New Game. Entering New Game is the biggest draw of the glitch of course, since
that lets you play through the main game with all the weapons. Entering the
Challenges with all the gear and infinite health will remove any challenge from
them, but there's more detail about the specific effects at the end of the
level-by-level sections.

You can also re-enter Combat Arena with NG+ glitch on. This causes a small side
effect where the camera starts at a different position at the start of a fight
and loading times appear to be shorter. But mostly, this variation is pretty
inconsequential.

- After starting NG+, you hear the Arena music play in the main menu for a
little while. If you try to change costumes during this time but instantly try
to cancel out of the menu by pressing circle, Kratos occasionally breaks free
and is able to move inside the main menu. There is more about this glitch at the
start of the level-specific glitches section.

- NG+ will not disable trophies.

- Any red orbs that you might’ve accumulated while setting up NG+ don’t seem to
carry over to a New Game.

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-_NXzZGs4


Other notes about infinite health:

- Some people have complained about losing infinite health at some point during
the game, but that has never happened to us during playing and testing.

- Kratos CAN actually take damage even with infinite health on, it's just
exceedingly rare. Few attacks like Hades' barbed wire deluge will still cause
damage like usual. Hera's Chalice will still drain Kratos' health as well.

- If Kratos falls into a bottomless pit with infinite health, he stops at the
death floor and starts shaking wildly. You usually can't control Kratos after
this, so you need to retry.

- Kratos is still not immune to all forms of death triggers. Some start a Game
Over without causing any damage, and Kratos is still vulnerable to those. You
find this sort of triggers at The Caverns for example.

- Infinite Health enables one unique type of infinite jump, called "Death
collision jump". There's more about it in the tricks section.



"Swimming glitch"

A fan favorite. Swimming glitch in God of War III works almost exactly the same
as it did in the previous titles: Kratos is able to swim like normal, except in
air. The glitch is started by hitting any water surface and then going out of
bounds, or the other way around... as simple as that.

You can...
- see the game levels from a whole new perspective!
- get past most obstacles without troubles.

You can't...
- open chests or operate many other R1-prompts.
- do almost any damage to enemies.

Swimming glitch ends, if...
- you hit water surface.
- you hit a climbing wall.
- you retry from some checkpoints.


Other notes:

You get an item called "Hades' Soul" after killing Hades, and that has the same
function as Trident did in the original God of War. Without it you can't dive at
will, which is very problematic for the purposes of this glitch. Kratos tends to
rocket skywards uncontrollably if he can't dive off the water surface but
instead swims off its edge. This doesn't mean it's impossible to start swimming
glitch before fighting Hades, but it is more difficult.

Sometimes while swimming around, Kratos enters t-pose. The most likely
explanation for this is that the game has unloaded the proper swimming animation
since you aren't supposed to be able to swim in most maps. It's just a visual
oddity and doesn't affect your ability to move around the game world.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58EUNH7_r2Y


"Reverse swimming glitch"

Much like you can swim where there's air, you can also go run laps somewhere
where there's supposed to be water. An example way to do this is to drop into
some pool from out of bounds, bypassing the water surface that would start
swimming-mode.

But there is also a technique to breach water surface at will in this game: jump
and spam Blades or Cestus magic while on water surface to have Kratos eventually
breach the surface and fall at the very bottom, still walking as if on land. A
very reliable way to do this is to hold R2 down, then spam X and square over
water with the correct magic active.

High jumps - introduction:

As the previous God of War-games have shown us, being able to jump higher or
longer than normal can have very destructive results. It is in fact entirely its
own glitching art form to generate techniques that can be used for doing the
highest or longest of jumps. So, let's see what jumping tricks GoW III has to
offer...


High jumps part I: "Severe Judgment jump"

The very first jump that was used for reaching higher-than-usual places was the
"Severe Judgment jump", which takes advantage of the normal momentum of a jump
combined with Whip's Severe Judgment (air) to reach a decent height.

Instructions: do a Severe Judgment (air) almost instantly after a double jump.
Then, cancel out of Severe Judgment at the top height by flicking Bow or Head on
very quickly. You are then free to follow up with any other normal air move.

You are able to traverse many places normally inaccessible to Kratos, especially
combined with Hermes Dash, which gives you even more height and also allows
Kratos to grab ledges from higher than he logically should.

Videos:
1, AKheon's tutorial of Severe Judgment and Sorrow Jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV9iThV4nao


High jumps part II: "Rage jump" (c: AKheon)

Rage Jump was another early high jump discovered in this game, and optimally it
grants even more height than Severe Judgment jump. To do it, flick Rage of
Sparta on and off very quickly during any air move while having a good vertical
air momentum. Cestus' Crushing Strike (air) seems to be the best attack for this
purpose, so feel free to try this jump out by doing CS as soon as possible after
a double jump, then flicking RoS on/off at the top.

This also has a strangely powerful effect when close to water: do a CS so that
Kratos is nearly touching the water surface, then flick RoS on/off. Kratos is
thrown upwards for almost a double jump's worth with one jump alone!

Jumps that use RoS do not obsolete Severe Judgment jump because:

1, SJ jump's superior air momentum helps grab out-of-reach ledges better.
2, RoS jumps are more arduous to perform.
3, you don't have RoS during all parts of the game.
4, likewise, on NG you don't have Whip to do Severe Judgment jump for most of
the time.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of doing a skip on NG with a Rage jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7-bnaYzpfA


High jumps part III: Special air attacks

Since the first GoW, the developers have realized that too much air mobility for
the player can be a dangerous thing, so they've tried to limit the number of
attacks that return Kratos back to a neutral state in air afterwards.
Regardless, a few still slipped through...

These attacks are:

- Claws' Combat Grapple (needs to hit something) (also called "Claws CG High
Jump")
- Augean Stampede (air)
- CG against burrowed Wraiths (also called "Wraith Jump")
- Tormenting Lash (air) (have to switch weapons during attack)
- Unending Sorrow (air) (have to switch weapons during attack) (also called
"Sorrow Jump")
- backwards Hermes Dash with any other weapon equipped than Blades

After Kratos returns back to a neutral state in air, you are able to use your
double jump or begin Gliding, giving you a lot of flexibility regarding
movement. Kratos also returns to a neutral state if you just fall for long
enough after your last air attack. But this takes way too long to be useful in
high jumps.

Some more info about these jump variations follow...


"Claws CG High Jump"

This is the closest thing to a traditional high jump this game has. Launch an
enemy and Kratos in the air, hit the enemy with Claws CG, then you are free to
do a double jump. For this game's standards, this jump kinda lacks a punch, but
it does have a use or two around the game.

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of Olympia ledge shortcut that uses this jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4K2_0JFlo


"Wraith Jump" (c: satvara)

One of the earlier high jumps. Kratos is able to return to neutral air state if
he uses Combat Grapple on a burrowed Wraith, and thus get higher than normal.

Videos:
1, satvara's original video featuring this jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWFRByy57Y#t=45


"Sorrow Jump" (c: AKheon)

Unending Sorrow (air) is overall the most "convenient" of all of these attacks
that return you back to a neutral air state since you can do it without any
enemies and it doesn't make Kratos lose too much height if your timing is good.

So, the instructions for this "Sorrow Jump". First, launch Kratos in the air.
The Whip ascension is recommended for doing this because it has a better air
momentum than the other ascension-type moves, meaning Kratos falls down slower
during Unending Sorrow (air). Whip's SJ ground is another good alternative,
although it gives you slightly less height.

At the top of the ascension, do Unending Sorrow. Switch weapons to Whip during
it. Then, at a precise moment, jump and follow it up with a Severe Judgment
jump. If you timed it correctly, you will rise a good length higher up than a
normal SJ jump would allow. It might not seem like much, but this small
increment in height already allows new skips around the game.

2, AKheon's video of skipping Blades of Exile with this jump:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrD3QjKBrP8


"Augean Stampede high jump" (c: AKheon)

Really a misleading term because you can't use Augean Stampede in a literal high
jump - it's just too slow for that. The move might come in handy in some very
specialized circumstances to reset Kratos' air state, but other than that, just
ignore this one.

Same goes for Tormenting Lash and backwards Jet Dash.


"Severe Judgment Pseudo-IJ" (c: findlestick)

If Severe Judgment (air) makes a "hit" as Kratos is on his way up, the next SJ
continues to make Kratos rise higher, unlike normal because of constantly
diminishing air momentum. Kratos will keep rising as long as he makes a new
"hit" with each successive SJ, so if you have a target you can hit over and over
again while rising, you can keep gaining height indefinitely. A good (but
useless) place to try it is at Olympia against Gaia's wrist.

Videos:
1, Findle's vid of the Pseudo IJ variation:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ2__QG86YE#t=283


Centaur jump (c: AKheon)

The Centaur is an unique Soul Summon that has a lot of collision to its body.
Kratos can Glide or fall against it if it is stationary right beneath him, and
apparently doing so for a few seconds resets Kratos' jump count and he can do
another double jump in air. This means you can use the Centaur as a sort of
movable platform from which to start Severe Judgment or various RoS jumps from.

The overall height you gain is roughly the same as in Sorrow Jump, but it
doesn't need Whip, so it's a useful variation to know. But it does have its
drawbacks too... General notes on this trick follow.

- You need Lv. 5 Claws to cast Centaur General, which can be a tall order in a
NG speedrun.

- You need a corner to keep the Centaur stationary enough that Kratos can
balance on top of it and regain his jumps.

- In some areas Centaur auto-targets nearby things and is fairly uncontrollable.

- The double jump effect doesn't work at every location...? Testing of this
trick is still underway.

- It's also possible to breach walls using the Centaur. But this is difficult to
do at will. Jumping against a wall or a corner while casting Centaur works, and
some spots are more reliable than others.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of Centaur jump and wall clip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhpljioZRgI


"Combat Grapple High Jump" (c: AKheon)

The combat grapples of this game work significantly differently compared to the
classic air grab: they do not bring enemies to Kratos, they take Kratos to
enemies. For high jump purposes, if the enemies happen to be flying very high in
the air, Kratos becomes quickly elevated too.

The question then shifts from finding exploits in Kratos' mechanics to finding
ways with which you can launch enemies as high as possible. Simply launching an
enemy isn't enough, though, as the enemy also has to survive being launched so
that you can CG them at the end of the combo. In rare cases, increasing
difficulty can give you more options for doing this jump, since it makes the
enemies more hardy too. A higher difficulty also increases the greatest
potential height you can gain with a single CG high jump.

The regular launchers from Blades of Exile and Claws are somewhat average for
starting this high jump with. Especially the BoE launcher is not only rather
damaging, but a little bit slow too. The Claws launcher fares better since it's
faster, and you can even do a "double launch" with it to get an enemy slightly
higher before Kratos even leaves the ground himself. However, as a drawback, the
CG of this weapon is useless for CG high jump since it doesn't take Kratos to
the enemy, forcing you to switch weapons during the combo to get anywhere.

The Nemesis Whip's ascension is most likely the best regular launcher for CG
high jump because of its unique multi-hitting nature and great speed. You can
easily do a double launch with it, and it seems to be the most gentle launcher
Kratos has at his disposal as well, so it's good if you're dealing with weaker
enemies.

Using the Bow is very useful for extending CG high jump. By spamming Bow shots
in between each CG, you can make an enemy rise up in the air while making Kratos
slowly sink downward, once again giving the two a good position in relation to
each other so that continuing doing CG will continue giving Kratos height. This
doesn't necessarily work with all enemies, though.

You can also juggle enemies with the Whip magic or Olympus Archers, but since
the latter is a Claws ability, it's somewhat difficult to utilize effectively.


General notes about the CG jump:

Bigger targets are easier to hit, and therefore, Minotaurs and Gorgons make the
best jump candidates. Archers are not good, not only because of their freakishly
low HP, but also because they are not suspended in air during CG. This makes it
impossible for you to gain decent height if you try to CG jump using them.

If a level has ambient movement, it may make it harder for Kratos to target foes
that are above him. For example, doing this jump at Gaia's Heart has proven to
be difficult.

CG high jump is mostly obsolete during NG+ because of Jest Jump (further below),
which is far easier and faster to do.

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIyhUboUws


"Jest Jump" or "Jest CG" (c: GeMStuff)

This is a glitch where a certain combination of moves affects the Combat Grapple
math. As a result, Kratos will be quickly launched into the air when he does a
CG to airborne enemies.

Instructions: do a fully charged Hermes Jest, press X at the end of it to launch
Kratos in air, and then successfully hit an airborne enemy (that is at a right
distance) with a Combat Grapple. The enemy will begin rising up in air very
rapidly after CG makes a contact, and Kratos becomes dragged upwards
simultaneously.

Jest Jump doesn't work with all enemies. Human-sized foes (except archers, lost
souls and civilians) are your best bet, as well as hounds, Skorpius spawn,
Sirens, etc. But Minotaurs and Gorgons are seemingly immune to it, and since
your foe has to be airborne for the glitch to happen, enemies like Taloses are
also out of the question. You must use other CG than Claws' because otherwise
Kratos himself won't gain height.

- You don't have to launch the enemy specifically using Hermes Jest. All that is
required for this trick to work is that an enemy of the correct type is airborne
at a correct distance when Kratos Grapples him after a charged Hermes Jest
launch. Even Zeus can be used to Jest Jump while he is airborne!

- If you CG an enemy that's too close to another launched enemy, the enemy you
are targeting might get "stuck" and not rise up fast enough to avoid getting
tackled by Kratos, and so the trick fails. So, avoid launching groups of enemies
in the air when doing Hermes Jest to avoid clutter.

- You get more height depending on your distance to the foe you are Grappling.

- If the enemy you are going to tackle has a too low HP, the CG will not let you
ascend. Instead, Kratos does a strange horizontal tackle to the enemy in air
without much height gain as the enemy dies.

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIyhUboUws


"Ladder Infinite Jump" (c: findlestick)

Early 2011, a particularly odd way was discovered to give Kratos infinite
height. As the name suggests, this infinite jump can only be done where there
are ladders, and you also need Boots and preferably upgraded Whip to do it.

For some reason, after jumping off a ladder, trying to do Hermes Dash makes it
immediately interrupt. Keeping the R-stick held down will start the Dash
endlessly again and again as it keeps interrupting, and as an extra feature
Kratos' momentum remains static during this time. So, if you just did an air
attack with great horizontal momentum, the glitched Hermes Dash barrage will
also make Kratos rise up in air indefinitely.

Here are simple instructions for doing the jump using the Whip and Bow, as it is
the easiest and most powerful combination of moves to get extra height. First,
get on a ladder, then jump off it. You then need to do a Severe Judgement while
in the air, and at a very precise moment - when you see Kratos rise up - press
L2 to take out Bow to interrupt the move and then start pressing forward with
the right analog stick (air Dash). It takes a few tries to learn the timing, but
when done correctly Kratos will rocket upwards.

This trick can be done with many other special moves too, but you have to
interrupt them with RoS, so these variations are not as convenient.

The most useful variation for NG is to simply Glide for a short time before
pushing R-stick. There's a certain point during the Glide when Kratos will get a
decent upwards momentum for seemingly no reason. This is slightly harder to get
the hang of than the Severe Judgment-variation, however.

It's lovely to rocket up infinitely high, but at this date Ladder Jump also
comes with some harsh restrictions. For example, making Kratos do a proper free
flowing Jet Dash during or after performing this jump seems impossible. At best
you can make Kratos temporarily move horizontally while in this state by
flicking the right analog stick forward - sometimes Kratos will do a short Dash,
during which you can start leaning forward on the right analog again to have
Kratos keep the forward momentum and start moving in air horizontally. But this
is hard to do at
will, and can't be relied on. Alternatively, you can spare your double jump for
more convenient navigation with the possibility to Glide after you've reached a
height suiting you.

It's not 100% clear as to why this jump is possible, but one theory could be
that when Kratos jumps back from a ladder he takes some of his "climbing data"
with him, and that combined with Dashing with Hermes Boots causes Kratos to
switch between his climbing data and dashing, thus causing strange breakouts
between the two. Sometimes a similar effect happens after hitting a rare type of
death collision as well...

"Death collision jump" (a.k.a. BJJ, Death Jump, etc.) (c: AKheon / findlestick)

The newest addition to the collection of jumps, this one is unique in that it
needs infinite health (NG+) for it to work. It also allows potentially infinite
height gain, which is rare in this game.

Some insta-death platforms throughout the game make Kratos enter a specific
death animation that features a small upwards "bounce" that gives him height.
This death animation can be cancelled by keeping L1 and L2 held down, which
makes it start anew, once again giving Kratos a bit of height, and so on,
potentially resulting in infinite height.

The effect varies depending on what weapon Kratos has equipped, but the only way
to actually gain height with this tactic is to keep Blades as your active weapon
- the death animation doesn't interrupt as quickly when having f.e. Cestus
active, preventing you from gaining height.

The persistence of the death animation as it will forever keep restarting is
also a bad thing, as it means that this jump can only be ended by landing on
solid ground (after which Kratos turns to normal). Kratos also can't really move
to any direction, other than if you turn RoS momentarily on and steer to a
direction, but doing this is painfully slow.

You can also invoke this specific death animation at will by Gliding or Alt Jet
Dashing against some slanted collision that prevents Kratos from landing for
15-17 seconds. Once you've done it, Kratos dies on the spot, but with infinite
health you can use his untimely death to start your infinite jump.

Another way to invoke this death animation is to freefall for a time while
holding down L1. It is sometimes a useful variation when Dashing deep out of
bounds without any other way to start rising upwards.

Double jump slightly higher

A small, occasionally useful mechanic in God of War III and Ascension. The game
thinks Kratos has already hit ground a little before he lands, allowing you to
do a new double jump from slightly in the air. This is useful for squeezing
everything out of your regular double jump.

"Double Glide jump" (c: findlestick)

If Kratos runs off a ledge while X is held down, he will instantly start a Glide
instead of falling, and at the end of this Glide he can do a double jump and yet
another Glide! This is quite a neat trick for extending Kratos' jumps in the
early game where you don't have Boots of Hermes yet. But it has the drawback
that you can't use it if a ledge is protected by an invisible collision "lip"
that prevents Kratos from running off it.

"Jet Dash" (c: findlestick)

The most important air movement technique in the game. To do it, you must have
Hermes Boots. Here's a video tutorial, for beginners.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT6wpckrTBI


The basic mechanism behind it is this: Hermes Dash allows almost completely
horizontal air movement for a brief time. The problem is that each Dash has a
rather big cooldown (to prevent abuse just like this technique). This cooldown
can be cancelled by flicking Bow or Head momentarily, making things smoother,
but not completely smooth because the Bow/Head has its own cooldown. However,
that too can be cancelled by doing a normal air attack. The Nemesis Whip's air
attack is recommended because it allows Kratos to stay in air the longest.


Jet Dash advantages:

+ Since this movement style is so fast, some areas can be got through before
everything in them has loaded, occasionally even allowing the skipping of events
or getting behind walls before they load.

+ Not only can you fly in a straight line, but you can maneuver around corners
and change directions mid flight, almost like a fly that buzzes around.

+ You can use it as a battle exploit in areas of the game where the battle is in
a confined space and you need to retreat very rapidly.

+ Kratos gains more height by each Dash if he does this technique against some
walls. It might be that the walls themselves have to be angled. This phenomena
is called "Jet Ascension."


Jet Dash disadvantages:

- At some parts of the game, there are invisible walls near ledges specifically
blocking air moves (even Dash). It's a hindrance more than a true disadvantage,
since you can first do a normal jump through the invisible wall and only then
begin Jet Dash.

- Unless on NG+, you have to wait until you get Boots of Hermes to do this.

- Some checkpoints take a few seconds before they become active, possibly
because of loading reasons. Since you move so fast with Jet Dash, you may have
Kratos end up in a strange situation, like get stuck or die, right before a
checkpoint activates. Then becoming checkpointed at that exact moment ruins your
progress.

- Sudden camera angle changes can make it difficult to steer Jet Dash.


"Alt Jet Dash / Blades Jet Dash" (c: AKheon)

Later on, an alternate method for doing Jet Dash was discovered. Alt JD is done
by having the Blades selected and Bow as the active gear, then jumping and
leaving L1+L2 pressed down while L-stick & R-stick are pushed to the direction
you want to go. The game does the rest for you: each Dash that Kratos starts is
automatically cancelled maybe 20 frames into the action, allowing you to get a
lot of fast movement with almost zero cooldown between each Dash.

You get a slightly different result depending on Kratos' angle during the
flight. Especially the sideways Dash moves Kratos extremely quick, so in a
speedrun, you want to keep Kratos angled sideways as often as possible when
doing this tactic. Otherwise, simply aiming forward is good enough, and you can
even cross large gaps without losing too much height during this movement.


Alt Jet Dash advantages:

+ Alt Jet Dash is extremely simple to perform: just hold a few buttons down in
air.

+ Alt Jet Dash is potentially much faster than regular Jet Dash, if you keep
Kratos angled sideways.

+ Alt Jet Dash doesn't require Whip for best results, which is good because
outside NG+ you don't have Whip with you for most of the game.

+ Most advantages of normal Jet Dash also apply.


Alt Jet Dash disadvantages:

- Forward Alt Jet Dash has a slower speed than with normal Jet Dashing.

- Sideways Alt Jet Dash is so fast that it becomes very difficult to control for
human reflexes.

- Jet Ascension doesn't seem to happen as much when doing Alt Jet Dash.

- Most disadvantages of normal Jet Dash also apply.

"Ledge levitation" or "Sky Jump" (c: satvara / findlestick)

In many places around the game you can make Kratos hover and gain height by
Gliding against a tight corner or another point where a hanging ledge and
collision intersect in a certain way. Kratos should Glide against the spot so
that his waist is roughly at the height of the ledge, and if the glitch happens,
Kratos will suddenly and uncontrollably fly in the air.

The glitch is fairly difficult to do at will. Most places where this effect
happens are fickle, and it may take many tries to get Kratos to hover. The
height you get also varies a lot, depending on your location and how lucky you
get. So while the trick has a use in a speedrun, it is often too risky to do in
other than segmented conditions.

If you can get Kratos to hang on a ledge and then move towards a rising floor -
possible to do in two or so maps around the game - this also produces a Sky
Jump-like effect.

It was only fairly recently discovered how to do this glitch at will, so there
may still be a lot to learn about it. It might turn out to be even more useful
in future speedruns.

“Air-walking” (c: findlestick)

There are very rare occasions when Kratos will start “Air-walking” if he touches
certain types of angled collision (usually ‘metallic-sounding’ collision) while
doing the Levitation glitch. I think this might happen if you kept ‘X’ held
during the setup for the Levitation glitch? Kratos starts running at the same
angle as the collision that triggered his Air-walk. The Air-walk looks like a
combined state between levitating and angled-running, because Kratos is running
while having some of the levitating properties.

Air-walking is a robust state that can be kept for as long as you want, unlike
regular Levitation which kills you after some time. Since Kratos is in a type of
ground-state, he can follow-up with other ground-actions in the air, like
rolling.

Air-walking should be explored more. Perhaps, like the Levitation glitch, there
might be more areas where it can be done? A good place to activate Air-walking
is at the chest belonging to the Judge near the grapple-points, in the Depths of
Hades. You have to get there while levitating.


Running on death collision:

If you have infinite health (from NG+ glitch), Kratos can stand on top of death
floor almost as if it was a normal floor and use it to run. You need RoS to
control Kratos after hitting the death floor, though. This trick is pretty
specialized and usually doesn't help because death floor is mostly only found
deep down in some pits where you never need to go in the first place.

If you do RoS attacks and shut off RoS during the time Kratos has a lot of
speed, Kratos will start gliding on the death floor super fast! That's something
fun to try out, at least.

Grab zipping (a.k.a. N-Zipping) (c: findlestick)

Normally enemies are unaffected by magic or other lingering attacks as they are
being grabbed. However, failing a grab is a different matter altogether. If you
fail a grab against certain enemies as they are getting damaged from lingering
effects such as Nemesis Rage magic or Soul Summon archers, Kratos will start
zipping rapidly around the place along with the enemy. This can lead him getting
a lot of extra horizontal speed, allowing a type of long jump to be made. It's
not easy to control, though, so it remains to be seen if this tactic will become
popular.

It's also barely possible to kill sentries twice with this tactic: first let
them die by magic damage as the grab is about to fail, then continue the grab to
kill them again.

"Lenient air momentum (LAM)" (c: AKheon)

In the original God of War, doing air specials right before hitting ground
caused their aerial momentum to linger on Kratos for a while, allowing better
jumps for a second or two. It's been recently discovered that you can create LAM
with certain moves in God of War III too, and do some high jump variations using
them.

First discovered way is to do Augean Stampede (air) at a certain height so that
it resolves right before hitting ground. Kratos also has to be running. If both
of these conditions are fulfilled, Kratos gets a nice amount of LAM for his
troubles. Second way is to do any air CG right before hitting ground, so that
Kratos sort of hovers above ground while finishing the move. If you cancel the
CG with Bow at this time, Kratos gets LAM once again.

LAM can also be created on water or rope by interrupting many slower air
specials, but this is not as useful as being able to do it on land.


Effects of Lenient Air Momentum:

- Your next air attacks will have superior air momentum. However, using a double
jump or ascension drains all LAM away, so you're restricted to using LAM with
only your first jump.

- If Rage is activated in air, Kratos gets a large height boost (at the expense
of destroying his current momentum).

- Certain attacks can stop at water surface if Kratos has lenient air momentum.
For example, Crushing Strike.

- in God of War 1, LAM caused other strange side effects as well, such as being
able to breach water surface or rising floor with attacks, or do triple jumps.
It remains to be seen if LAM in God of War III has any side effects like that.

Double jump through wall (c: AKheon)

This is an exploit that exists in God of War III but was later fixed in
Ascension. If you manage to get Kratos in a tight enough spot that his double
jump no longer gives him any height, at a certain angle there's a chance that
doing a double jump will let him breach nearby walls.

This mechanism might be behind the Centaur wall breach technique as well. Ought
to be tested some more.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of doing this at Palace of Hades (at the start of the video):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8vvjg19750


"Magneto Jump" (c: findlestick):

In early 2021 it was discovered that Kratos’ ability to detect ledges could be
greatly amplified. Magneto Jump is both a High Jump-technique as well as a type
of wall breach-method. It gives Kratos the ability to magnetically grab ledges
that are up to 7-9 times his own height (possibly even higher?). It also gives
Kratos the ability to grab ledges that should be too low for him to reasonably
grab, such as chests, and even ledges that are on the ground. Any ledge that is
below neck-high, which the game considers to be 'grabbable', can also be grabbed
with this technique.

Grabbing extremely low ledges forces Kratos' body through the floor. Therefore,
you can drop through the floor simply by letting go of the ledge. Magneto Jump
also lets you do two consecutive Severe Judgement jumps; both which actually
gain height.

The downside of this technique is that it requires Kratos to hit certain types
of collision that boosts his attack-momentum: "Boost-collision".

Boost-collision types include:
-enemies (all?): a controlled method to use enemies, is to Stone-freeze them
near the ledge you want to grab.
-Permanent Olympus Archer souls.
-pots (all?).
-brambles (all?).
-Poseidon Princess.
-Gaia's wrist, at City of Olympia.
-doesn't seem to work on Wandering Souls?
-Civilians? §

So far, this technique has only been tested with Severe Judgement-attack. § So
for now, that is what will be used for the instructions:

For grabbing ledges high-up: hit "Boost-collision" with a Severe
Judgement-attack, after a jump or jumps. Near the peak of your SJ, air-dash once
towards the ledge and then flick Bow, or head.

For low ledges: same as above, except use just one jump.

It's very important that Kratos dashes directly square in the direction of the
ledge you want to grab. The timing of the dash and bow/head-flick is the most
important factor, if you want Kratos to magnetically grab the ledge. Learning
the timing isn't easy at first, but once you understand the timing and
positioning, you'll be able to do it consistently.

Tidbits about some other mechanisms:
-----------------------------------

Auto-saves:

- They are not exactly the same as checkpoints or normal saves, though sometimes
the three overlap.

- If you sequence break too heavily, the auto-save labels become confused. For
example, early chain break causes the Zeus auto-saves to be labeled "Hermes".


Cutscenes (using game engine):

- Cutscene triggers make Kratos break out of seemingly every attack.

- If an enemy gets stuck on Kratos' path during a cutscene, Kratos ignores it
but can't push the enemy away either. He just twists about until he has passed
the obstacle or the obstacle has left on its own volition. Cutscene proceeds
like normal.

-  During most scripted scenes Kratos can't be hit by enemies. However, on the
rare occasion he is vulnerable to attacks, and glitches typically follow. The
cutscene where you pick up the goblet after arriving at the Gardens is one
example of such a cutscene.


Cutscenes (pre-rendered):

- Pre-rendered cutscenes are usually reserved for really important moments in
the game, like character deaths or if Kratos moves to a whole new level.
Sequence breaking-wise it's hard to get around them because they are usually
tied to critical loading triggers.

- In at least one spot in the game (chain breaking), it's possible to enter the
save menu right as a cinematic begins. The cinematic plays in the background of
the save menu without audio. Saving and reloading, retrying from checkpoint or
just exiting the save menu causes some complications in the frame rate and audio
of the FMV, and there's a chance that the game crashes after the FMV. If you
wait out in the menu until the FMV ends, the game won't crash, but the audio of
the FMV plays out by itself as normal gameplay continues. If you now exit to the
main menu, the FMV audio continues to play in the background!

- Forcing the save menu on top of an FMV can't be used as an in-game time speed
strategy because time still runs while the cinematic is in the background.


Grapple points:

- If you cast magic after letting go of a grapple point with any other weapon
active than the Blades, instead of doing the sub-weapon's own magic, Kratos does
a graphic-less Army of Sparta or Divine Reckoning (depending on which Blades you
are using).

- After letting go of a grapple point, there's quite a bit of cooldown before
you can activate Rage of Sparta, for some reason.

- You can use a grapple point while grabbing Sentries, causing the animations
and mechanics to overlap in a very odd looking way.

Videos:
1, findlestick's video of combining grapple points and grabs:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apxtyRtjU7g


Movable objects:

- Vulcairn discovered that getting hit in the same frame as Kratos is grabbing a
movable bramble pot can cause the pot to become stuck on Kratos. After that it
just becomes fixed on Kratos as if it had no weight of its own. The glitch may
end if Kratos enters an in-game cutscene or does certain attacks.

Videos:
1, Vulcairn's video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwQD3KOEUFk


Stonefreeze:

- Stonefreezing works a bit differently from the previous games. For instance,
your foes can be frozen in any position, instead of them being replaced by a
generic 'statue' when they are stonefrozen.

- Stonefrozen targets can't be Combat Grappled, grabbed or hit with Fiery
Inferno.

- Any falling enemy, even if only partially stonefrozen, will become shattered
  upon landing.

- Kratos can't be stonefrozen when he is riding a foe.

- If Kratos has infinite health (combat arena, NG+), enemies can't break his
stonefrozen form with their attacks. But falling down while stonefrozen will
still kill Kratos instantly.

- If Kratos becomes stonefrozen while gliding with Wings, he will continue
gliding safely all the way to the ground level despite becoming a statue.

- Rage of Sparta breaks you out of being stonefrozen instantly.


Portals:

- If you cast magic when entering a portal, you can expect some graphical
glitches (like screen changing color but nothing else happening).

- At some portals, if you attack instantly after coming out, Kratos will climb
on an invisible rope for an instant, then stops. This also happens if you swim
through those portals.

- At some portals, if you glide in them with Wings, Kratos will glide out too,
except in a strange position and Wing-less.

- If a portal malfunctions, Kratos just falls out-of-bounds to his death.
Reason... loading error? Unknown at the moment.

- With the exception of the dogs at the dog kicking puzzle inside the Poseidon's
Chamber, enemies are not programmed to enter through portals. Should Kratos
interact with an enemy as they pass through a portal together, the game reacts
strangely to this. Kratos can pass but the enemy cannot, resulting in
interesting breakouts, including an invisible force that thrashes Kratos around
the room violently, and Kratos performing a killing animation while being
transported back and forth from Portals.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o0CedIfpuA#t=121


Ropes:

- Most attacks cancel immediately if Kratos touches a rope during them, but not
all. For example Whip's Deadly Reprisal (air) looks really fun if you do it on
rope, with Kratos doing the attack while attached to the rope.

- Kratos is unable to latch onto rope during some attacks. Most noticeably
during any ascension.


Some unassorted mysteries:

- Kratos inexplicably falls through the floor while fighting Skorpius.

Cyclops.

Teleportation Triggers:

While the world of God of War III seems seamless and logical as you play the
game, it is in fact made of separate, smaller maps that Kratos is moved between
using teleportation triggers. The actual location of the different maps in the
game's larger coordinate system is usually bizarre, having no relation to how
the areas "appear" to be placed according to the game world's logic. Using
glitches like air swimming, it's possible to go around teleportation triggers
and experience this discrepancy first-hand. Sometimes you can even reach the
next map early without using the teleportation trigger but rather by navigating
to the actual location of the next map.

The level-by-level glitches section will list the various teleportation
Triggers, as well as the actual location of the next area, if this information
is available.


Weapons and magic:

A. General Moves

Auto-targeting problems:

Many attacks, including grabs and combat grapples, are subject to the strange
auto-targeting system this game has. It overrides player's commands and often
makes Kratos attack enemies he wasn't even facing. The game seems to favor
bigger and "more important" enemies over smaller. This is very bad in fights
such as the one against Hades Cerberus Breeder, causing the strategy of grabbing
puppies and throwing them back at HCB to backfire if the Satyrs or HCB are too
close to Kratos. It also messes up CG high jump attempts pretty often. I've
heard a patch has fixed the auto-targeting issues, though.


Grabs:

It's sometimes possible for Kratos to grab a wrong enemy when there are two near
each other, even if the other one is immune to grabs at the moment.

Videos:
1, JolieLegal’s video of grabbing the wrong Cerberi at hades Palace:
        https://youtu.be/0lu-HKvEszk


Pressing R1 at the end of some moves (like the second square hit in BoA/BoE
combo) cancels the recovery animation the move has, returning Kratos to standing
upright or in a battle-ready idle stance. Just a hidden property in some moves.


Air grab break-outs: (c: GeMStuff?)

It's possible to break Kratos out of air grabs almost instantly after they
start. The enemy will enter the air grab animation while Kratos is free to move
and do other things, and this looks quite stylish when making specialized
combos, if nothing else. There are two known techniques for doing this, and they
are...

1, Claws' air 'triangle' (bounceable foes only). Hit your enemy so that he will
bounce in air, and do a grab right before Kratos hits the ground.

2, use Whip's ascension. Tap triangle twice to launch the foe and get Kratos
only slightly up in the air. Cancel the ascension by flicking Bow/Head, then do
a quick air grab.

If this trick is done to Harpy Queens, they become able to 'duplicate'. As you
jump from one Harpy to another, hitting the second Harpy causes the first Harpy
to re-appear in Kratos' hands (despite having been torn apart a second ago).
This does not count as a kill, and might be useful during Harpy crossings in a
pacifist run!


A lift-up to follow a normal ascension can be done in two ways: either by
keeping triangle held down, or by letting go of triangle once the attack is on
its way and then pressing X. Just a small detail. There are a few special moves
in the game as well that will launch Kratos if the player presses X during them.


Air Combat Grapples can be interrupted by casting magic, which can look a little
strange. You can also cause a graphical glitch using BoE magic: do Blades air
combat grapple, switch to another weapon, then cast magic. The magic Army of
Sparta begins, but most of the special effects don't show.

Claws of Hades, Nemean Cestus and Nemesis Whip have combat grapples you can
buffer endlessly by keeping L1+O held down.


Moves that end with Kratos rushing down (Tartarus Rage (air), Crushing Strike
(air)) can cause a glitch when done against a water surface from a correct
height. Kratos gets "stuck" on top of the water surface for a few moments, as if
falling but frozen in air.


If you hold R2 down, you enter a mode in which pressing any combat-related
buttons causes Kratos to do magic, although he can otherwise move normally. Best
effects can be seen with Claws, Cestus or Whip magic.


Some attacks that don't become cancelled by a weapon switch are subject to wrong
weapon graphics if you switch weapons at a correct time. The attack's properties
change in a subtle way in the process, for example many wrong weapon attacks
can't be interrupted by blocking or rolling although it is otherwise possible.
The attack's damage modifier may also change in the process. Rapid Switches are
the easiest attacks to do using a wrong weapon.


You don't have the ability to Rapid Switch until you've more than one weapon in
your arsenal.

Oddities about specific Rapid Switch-moves are listed in the weapons-section
below, although the game lists them as general moves.


B. Blades of Athena

You have these Blades at the beginning of the game, and you can also toggle
between them and Blades of Exile by toggling the Godly Possession Aphrodite's
Garter on or off. BoA works pretty much identically to the Blades you had in God
of War II.

These Blades have a poor damage modifier, and you can't improve it because BoA
can't be leveled up either. However, a small exploit exists for increasing your
damage: if you switch to BoE in the middle of a BoA attack, the attack's damage
is calculated through BoE damage modifier instead. Best in conjunction with
multi-hitting special moves. You need Aphrodite's Garter to do this, of course.


Both of the Blades in this game are able to do combos that continue onto another
weapon (Claws). For example: switch to Claws during the fifth hit in the square
combo, and continue with a square or triangle attack. Depending on your timing,
you are able to pull off a Claws light or heavy finisher out of nowhere, or a
Plume with another weapon's graphics. Unfortunately this does not work with any
other weapons, the combo just cuts off unremarkably.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of doing a Blades -> Claws combos:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSF2kOCNIY0#t=8


You are able to do Blades of Exile's Rapid Switch using BoA! Jump down while
blocking, and after landing quickly switch weapons to something else and press
X. Instead of Icarus Ascension, you get the Rapid Switch.

An alternative method to do this is to do a roll. During the roll switch weapon
to anything else and hold block. Kratos should enter a wrong blocking stance for
just a moment, and during this time you can press X to do Rapid Switch.

Videos:
1, AKheon's video of using BoE Rapid Switch with BoA:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSF2kOCNIY0#t=43


Icarus Ascension is immune to gravity, and it can be done on top of pits without
Kratos falling down. It is also an unique ascension in the sense that it gives
far better air momentum than most other ascensions, and can be better for high
jumps because of it.


Cyclone of Chaos hits 10 times if Kratos is right next to the enemy and all the
hits hit.


Since Tartarus Rage (air) continues indefinitely as long as you don't hit the
ground, it's possible for you to balance precariously on top of bigger enemies
(like Taloses) and gain a lot more hits than normally possible. This technique
is not easy to do.


Hyperion Rise is another ascension that has the sweet property of "defying
gravity." You can do it over chasms, and Kratos won't bat an eyelid.


Divine Reckoning:

- This magic only has a ground version. If you try to cast it in air, Kratos is
brought down to the ground level extremely quickly before the magic is cast.

- It seems to hit a maximum of 9 times.

- Like all ground-only magics, you can breach the water surface by spamming this
on top of water for long enough.

- Kratos is invincible while casting this magic.

- If you switch Aphrodite's Garter on/off as this magic is being cast, it loses
its graphical effect. It doesn't get interrupted and still does damage, though.



C. Blades of Exile

New Blades that you get from Athena near the start of the game. They're close to
the classic Blades in functionality. The biggest difference is the different
triangle combos, and the few new special moves like CG and Rapid Switch.


There's a chance to do a shared combo with Claws using either of the Blades.
With BoE, both fifth square hit and second triangle hit allow weapon switching
during the move, after which you can continue the combo into a Claws finisher or
a Blades attack with wrong weapons graphic (depending on your timing). It's too
bad that this doesn't work with other weapons, the combo just ends.


If you change weapons during the ground Rapid Switch, the move only does its
first hit and then abruptly ends. Air Rapid Switch goes further and cuts off
immediately if you try to switch weapons during it.


If you hold L1, switch weapons away from Blades and then do Combat Grapple, you
get a slightly glitched Grapple. For example, you can do a regular style grapple
using Cestus or Claws, and they create a smaller knockback than Blades CG.


If you Dash towards a climbing wall from a certain distance and hold block when
hitting the wall, Kratos will enter a mixed state between climbing and blocking.
He looks like he's attached to the wall in blocking pose for a few seconds, then
everything returns to normal. The only attack you can do in this state is the
air Blades Rapid Switch.


Rage of Sparta "exploit":

At BoE levels one to four, if you upgrade weapons or switch Aphrodite's Garter
on/off with Rage of Sparta active, it will cut off suddenly. On the surface,
this seems like just another way of turning RoS off, but it has the hidden
additional property of also cancelling the cooldown RoS has, meaning that you
can activate another RoS pretty much instantly afterwards. For some reason this
no longer works at BoE lv. 5.

I've tried making high jumps somehow even higher using this mechanism, but if
you cancel RoS this way your air momentum becomes very bad and you fall down to
ground almost instantly. It could have a very small use in the CS high jump,
which you can now extend with another CS and RoS cancel for more height, but
it's not much and the conditions are quite specialized, so...

Note: RoS also won't get cancelled if you're using the NG+ glitch, regardless of
your BoE level. There are some other conditions to this too, one of which might
be related to Godly Possession usage, which prevents this "glitch" from
occurring.


Army of Sparta:

- As with Divine Reckoning, this magic is ground-only.

- Kratos is invincible while casting it.

- If you switch Aphrodite's Garter on/off as this magic is being cast, it loses
its graphical effect. It doesn't get interrupted and still does normal damage,
though. Same thing if you upgrade Blades while casting the magic.

- If you do Blades air combat grapple, then switch to another weapon, then press
R2, Kratos does this magic but the graphics are again glitched.



D. Claws of Hades

Hades' own weapon, forcibly taken from him in the first quarter of the game.


The small hop Kratos does during the fourth square hit is just for show, he
doesn't actually leave the ground.

The fifth square hit induces a Orion's Harpoon-like effect to the foe that was
hit. It doesn't work on all foes, even those that can be Orion's Harpooned
normally.

The 'triangle' ground hits form violet clouds that always appear at a fixed
distance away from Kratos. They are not constrained by collision, and so you can
use them to deal heavy damage from behind obstacles and walls. I think they also
have a decent radius of effect to them.

These clouds deal damage for a short time after the triangle attack hits the
ground. If you switch to the Cestus during the triangle attack, you are able to
destroy the onyx shield from enemies with only Claws attacks.

Videos:
1, Jolielegal's video of destroying shields with Claws:
        https://youtu.be/A0hotjXKBBg


Using the 'triangle' air hit, you can create air grabs which Kratos breaks out
of with bounceable foes. I think this is because the moment when the enemy
becomes bounced is so late during the move. There's a little more about broken
air grabs in the General Moves-section above.

You can do infinite ground combos using the two very versatile combo moves:
ascension (without lift-up) and Mourner's Lament (avoid finisher).


While blocking, you hear the sound effect for it repeat periodically for no
reason. Maybe a bad sound loop?

If you cast a Soul shortly after quickly blocking in air, Kratos gets stuck in
block-stance while falling even after you let go of L1.


If you do this weapon's Rapid Switch, but use directional keys to switch weapon
to anything else but Nemean Cestus instantly after the move begins, and hold
block after the move ends, Kratos enters a glitchy blocking state which stays
active on its own even after you let go of L1. If enemies attack him, he just
sorta slides away from the attack instead of doing any sort of reacting
movement. Unblockable attacks still hit you like normal. You can do nothing in
this mode except use magic, items or do another Rapid Switch (which always
switches weapon to Nemesis Whip/Blades, as if your weapon was NC all the time)
after which the glitch ends. If you accidentally hit an enemy while preparing
this glitch, your weapon will switch back to Cestus, which is pretty strange.

Other small things about the Rapid Switch. During this move, Kratos moves at a
very fast speed and a bit flattened due to his pose, making it suitable for
getting him into cramped spaces. For example, this is the only known move with
which Kratos can squeeze himself through/behind the Path of Eos sightseeing
pedestal (if it should count).

The air version of this weapon's Rapid Switch allows a barebones "long jump"
that would come in handy before acquiring the Boots of Hermes; sadly, you don't
get Cestus after you already have the Boots which give you a much better long
jump in the form of Jet Dash. Simply do the move, but switch back to Claws as
quick as possible. Repeat. With quick fingers, you will move a bigger distance
in air than with just gliding with Wings.

Although both of these Rapid Switches are done with Cestus out, they don't
damage onyx targets like Judges' stones. The onyx rules are pretty arbitrary in
this game...


Tormenting Lash (air) is a rare air move after which Kratos can do a jump… but
only if you switched to another weapon during the move. This is not as useful as
doing the same thing with Unending Sorrow.


Unending Sorrow allows you to lift Kratos up if you press X at the end. It's a
sort of secret within the move.

A more interesting secret is found from the air version of this move. If you
switch weapons during it, Kratos returns to idle state at the end and you can do
your 2nd jump or Glide in air. This can be used for doing the highest known high
jumps in the game.

And... one last thing. If you buffer a square hit after Unending Sorrow (air) at
a correct time, you will get an air triangle hit instead for no reason!


This weapon's air Combat Grapple (contacting a foe) is one of the very few
attacks that allow Kratos to jump in air after usage. Another thing: only one
batch of skulls can be out at any time - additional combat grapples have no
effect until the previous skulls disappear.

If you block, then switch weapons and do Combat Grapple, the ensuing grapple is
a glitched one. It does extremely little damage and causes knockbacks (to some
enemies). Pretty useless overall.


Soul Summon:

A new type of magic in God of War III. Summons can be cast without a particular
animation, although there is a short "pause" after each casting during which you
can't do other moves or activate R1-prompts, etc.

There's a hefty cooldown on many summons. You can bypass this cooldown once by
entering Start-menu. Since in this game using the menu doesn't count against
your time, this is a viable speed strategy for dealing more damage in less time.

- If a Soul is summoned on an uneven surface, or on slippery collision, the
Souls will instantly despawn/self-cancel. The exception to this are the Olympus
Archers, they will stay around permanently after being summoned (see the section
titled: “Permanent Archer Souls”).

- None of the souls have any weight. You can't press buttons on the ground by
placing souls on them, for example.

- Souls fall through water surfaces unaffected.

- Switching to another soul while another is still on the field makes the first
soul(s) disappear.

- Some Souls give hits from unique targets that don't give hits otherwise.
Likewise, some souls don't give hits even though they ought to.

- Selecting a new soul while the previous one is still on the field tends to
make the game crash on the PS3 version, so better not play around with it too
much. This doesn’t happen on PS4, instead, doing this makes any existing Souls
to despawn.

Tidbits on particular Souls:

"Cerberus Mongrel". If cast towards walls in air, it sort of sticks to the walls
and descends slowly, unlike other summons.

"Olympus Archer" can be used to juggle enemies. The effect is stunning with four
archers and Kratos himself shooting arrows at some airborne foe. Each archer
shoots 8 shots before dissipating. Summoning Archers at a certain time that
Kratos does a single jump towards tight collision, can squeeze Kratos between
the collision, which can then let you Double-jump out-of-bounds at some areas.
Olympus Archer Souls that fail to despawn have strange properties that can be
used in High Jumps and collision breaches (see “Permanent Archer Souls” section,
for more).

"Gorgon Serpent" is one of the rare ways to stonefreeze your enemies in this
game. Not as efficient as stonefreezing in previous games. It's also useful for
controllably setting up Magneto Jumps, by freezing enemies near some ledge you
want to grab, high or low.

"Olympus Fiend" is a quick, spammable launcher-in-a-pocket. They can explode in
air if you had enough height when casting them.

"Chimera" shoots fire balls, but they don't actually light things on fire.
Chimera's attack works as a "dissension", bringing any airborne enemies down as
they are hit.

"Cyclops Berserker" falls through walls and floors quite easily.

"Centaur General" is the summon that has the most collision in its body, which
means it can be utilized in some interesting ways outside combat. It can push
Kratos a noticeable length if you cast it next to a wall and Kratos is in the
way. Kratos can even become pushed off rotating cranks this way. If moving when
cast, Kratos zips a small length forward. You can also do the Centaur Jump using
it, as detailed above in the glitch tactics section.

"Siren Seductress'" shockwave effect is not visible at every location. The
attack itself may or may not do damage if this happens.


"Permanent" Olympus Archer souls (c: findlestick):

Casting Archer souls on uneven collision, or casting them as Kratos is landing
on slippery collision, causes the Archer souls to not despawn. The properties of
Permanent Archer souls are very different to regular Archer souls.

Here's a list of some of these properties and related things of interest:

- Only four Permanent Archers can exist at any time, nothing happens if you try
to summon more. However, Kratos regains the ability to summon Archers when he
moves far enough away from them. Possibly due to the Permanent Archers unloading
if Kratos is too far from them?

- Permanent Archer souls have “Boost-collision”, so they can be used to do
Magneto Jumps, with at least Severe Judgement (untested with other
attacks/weapons). §

- Once spawned, the Archer will either stay where it spawned, slide around
randomly, or will always specifically slide to some point on the map.

- They have solid collision that register hits by certain (all?) attacks.

- They can be used to build up your Rage Meter, by hitting them.

- They can also be used to obstruct some physical mechanisms around the game.

- When attacked, they bleed A LOT!

- Kratos can't walk through them, and he can only move them slightly with his
body. Attacks are best for moving them, though some attacks are better than
others for this.

- Kratos can Combat Grapple towards them, and results vary depending on your
equipped weapon:

With Blades and Nemesis Whip: Kratos starts a Combat Grapple but you can then
redirect the destination of the Grapple. With the right setup, this is a type of
locale-specific long jump for NG, or used as a method to navigate while
out-of-bounds, but this needs to be fleshed-out more.

With Hades Claws: Kratos gets knocked back and grunts. Sadly, they can’t be used
to do Claws CG High Jump.

With Cestus: Kratos tries to bring the archer to him, but the archer won't
budge, Kratos gets stuck-in-place for a few seconds, in an odd pose.

At some areas -- like the Chamber of the Flame and some sections of the Hermes
chase -- the combat grapple tries to grapple something unseen off-screen. This
causes his blades to zip around chaotically with the graphics really messed-up.

- They can't seem to be launched by any means? If we could find a way to, we
would be able to infinitely launch them with Bow/Combat Grapple, since they
never die. Or at least, do some decent, custom Combat Grapple-jumps. §

- Shooting them with Nemesis Rage keeps its effects lingering. This might be
useful to do some Grab zipping (a.k.a. N-Zipping jumps). Or to use them as
custom "timebombs"; maybe leave them around with Nemesis Rage lingering as an
enemy appears (while Kratos is frozen) in an attempt to damage the enemy before
you're supposed to? (f.e at the start of the Hades battle, as Hades tries to
steal Kratos' soul). Or to end some battle with them, that has some event/scene
timed to occur after it, while Kratos is away doing something unrelated? §

E. Nemean Cestus

A pair of giant fists taken from Hercules. Acquired around the half-way point in
the game.


It's difficult to see, but when you block with Nemean Cestus, Kratos is making
an angry grin, like when attacking.

Blocking in air a little before hitting ground makes Kratos land without an
animation. Looks slightly odd.


The first part of the square attack seems to be useful for getting Kratos into
cramped spaces, because he moves at a quick pace and collision a bit flattened
(due to his sideway pose).


You can do a glitched Cestus Plume that does no damage to anything. First choose
Blades as the active weapon. Press block for a moment, then switch weapons to
Cestus and hold down triangle. If done with the correct timing, Kratos will
switch to Cestus and do an unexplainable Plume with Cestus in hands. This is
easier if you haven't learned Blades' L1+t move yet.


If you do the ground Rapid Switch, but switch weapons back to Cestus before the
move ends, and do L1+O as quickly as possible afterwards, the move that begins
is Blade of Exile's Hyperion Ram! And this is regardless of your current Blades
at the moment - it works even at the beginning, where you don't have BoE yet
(NG+).


Augean Stampede (air) is one of the very few air attacks in this game after
which Kratos can do a jump. Attacks like these can be the ingredients of high
jumps, but this one is just too slow to be of any use in something like that. On
another note, Augean Stampede (air) can be used to do the lenient air momentum
glitch if the move entirely resolves before Kratos lands and he is running.


Crushing Strike (air) is a useful move for high jumping because of the height
boost it gives with RoS cancelling. It is also the only known air attack in the
game which will continue until Kratos hits solid ground (or some types of
insta-death collision.) This feature came in handy in one of the Olympus Garden
skips!


You can increase Cestus quick rolling speed by holding down L1 and spamming
square while doing forward rolls. This way Kratos won't waste time doing the
first square hit between each roll.


After starting a forward roll and buffering Savage Charge, if you switch
weapons, Kratos gets completely stuck with his weapons out. You can only rotate
him around and not do anything else. You got to retry or get hit by an enemy for
the state to end. Note that you can turn RoS on and watch enemies fail to damage
Kratos while he is in this ridiculous looking situation as a humorous bonus.


The CG of this weapon is different from the others in that it pulls the enemy to
Kratos (instead of Kratos pulling himself towards the enemy). It does not always
work because many enemies are immune to it, and even normal enemies have phases
during which they can't be hit with it. Due to a glitch, it occasionally
launches some enemies (Minotaurs at least) very high into the air after hitting.


Nemean Roar:

- Kratos is invincible while casting it. While casting, Kratos moves through
enemies/targets as if they weren't there.

- This is a useful move for pushing non-enemy characters around the game world
(like Poseidon Princess).

- Like Divine Reckoning or Army of Sparta, this magic is ground-only.

- It damages some onyx targets, some it leaves unscathed.

- This magic might not do full damage to targets which become bounced.

- You can cancel out of the fully upgraded magic after its mid-way by doing a
jump.



F. Nemesis Whip

An electric, whip-like weapon forged by Hephaestus after beating Cronos. Has
many pretty unique functions compared to the other weapons.

The Whip is a pretty slippery weapon and its attacks start automatically if you
just hold the respective attack button down when switching weapons, unlike with
Blades, Claws or Cestus. This works both on air and ground.

Whip has many attacks you can extend indefinitely by keeping the attack button
pressed. This also works with several of its air moves. If you accumulate a long
enough combo, unusual orbs will start pouring out of enemies - magic, rage and
possibly even health orbs are possible.


Using the unique multi-hitting ascension move ('triangle'), you can create
glitched air grabs during which Kratos is free to move around the place. There
was more about broken air grabs in the General Moves-section above.


Ground Severe Judgment makes Kratos do a pretty high jump up in the air. It does
not lift him to the same height a normal ascension does, but it does leave him
with good air momentum, allowing this move to be sometimes useful in Sorrow
Jumping (for example, in spots where you don't have room to do the normal Whip
ascension and don't want to bother with Icarus Ascension). Another asset of this
move is that it "defies gravity", in other words, it does not cut off even if
Kratos takes a step over a chasm.

Severe Judgment (Air) is a move which is useful in high jumping. As long as your
current momentum is good, you gain a lot of height by doing this move in air
(and cancelling out of it with, f.e. Bow). It also has the property of launching
ground enemies if you manage to connect it.


Deadly Reprisal does not leave ground although it looks like Kratos is leaping.

Deadly Reprisal (Air) looks very cool if extended by holding 'triangle' down. It
also has a special glitch effect if done right before Kratos latches onto a
rope: Kratos does his lunge while staying on the rope's level before the move
finally ends and he starts hanging from the rope like normal.


If you have BoA as your Blades, you can only buffer into a square attack from
Whip's ground Rapid Switch (unlike with BoE). This is because of the
fundamentally different triangle attacks between the Blades.

The air Rapid Switch has a few oddities with it. First, if you cancel it with
Bow or Head, Kratos becomes stalled in the air for a moment. Second, if you
switch weapons to something else than Blades, the move's properties change a
bit. You can't cancel it with an air grab or Bow/Head any longer, for example.


Nemesis Rage:

- Kratos is invincible while casting it.

- It gives you hits even when it strikes special targets that won't give hits
otherwise.

- If the bolt hits an obstacle instead of an enemy, it dissipates a lot faster
than it should. But sometimes the attack just cuts off too soon for no reason
even when hitting an enemy properly.

- A single lv. 3 attack seems to hit max. of 22 times.



G. Items

Bow of Apollo:

- Fiery Inferno arrows pass through targets, and can as such hit and light
multiple targets on fire.

- Enemies light on fire in different ways. Some can only be lit once at a time,
but some (like cyclops) can be repeatedly lit on fire. Fire can spread from one
target to another if they're close enough, but this doesn't happen with all
enemies. Some foes don't light on fire at all.

- If you upgrade this item while you are charging Fiery Inferno, the graphical
effect of gathering fire disappears.

- You can start sliding with the Bow equipped by using Soul Summon at a precise
time. More detailed instructions to come, but for now, here's a video.

Videos:
1, findlestick's video:
        https://youtu.be/apxtyRtjU7g?t=239



Head of Helios:

- Solar Flare can stun enemies for decent periods of time. Weak foes stun longer
while some stronger ones only stun momentarily or not at all.

- During Solar Flare, the sounds of the game fade momentarily. Very noticeable
if you visit the menu as the screen flashes.

- If you upgrade this weapon while it's active, all graphical effects disappear
momentarily.

- If you evade at a correct time after flicking on Head (or after doing either
of its attacks), you will evade as if you had the BoA or BoE equipped regardless
of what weapon you were currently using. After only one roll, Kratos switches
back to using your current weapon's evade move.

- If you cast Helios Flash in air so that the flash begins right before hitting
ground, and then refrain from pressing any buttons, Kratos's stance remains that
of the HoH but with a weapon out instead of the head. It seems this is only a
cosmetic thing, and it ends as soon as you move Kratos.

- Alternatively, you can do the same thing while running. Kratos enters the Head
of Helios walking animation but with his weapon out instead of the Head, and his
walking is sped up in a comical looking way. If you have Cestus on, you can also
see Kratos wearing both of his Cestuses in his hands and one extra Cestus on his
back! Comical, but again only a cosmetic thing.

- Like with Bow, you can start sliding with Head equipped by using Soul Summon.



Boots of Hermes:

- Hermes Dash is the key ingredient for the all-purpose horizontal movement tool
"Jet Dash".

- If you do a backwards Dash with a non-Blades weapon equipped, Kratos returns
to idle state at the end of it and is able to use his 2nd jump or Glide in air
afterwards.

- Hermes Rush/Jest allows Kratos to pass through some projectile attacks without
damage.

- Hermes Jest allows glitched, extremely high launches in certain conditions.
Read more in the section about "Jest Jump" far above. Also, if you try to cast
Cestus' magic after using the Jest lift-up, the magic which starts is a
graphic-less version of the Blades magic.

- If you upgrade Boots while doing its basic move in air, after landing there is
one frame of time during which you can interrupt the move by jumping which is
normally not there... curious.



H. Relics

Icarus Wings:

- Probably for reasons of Rapid Switch convenience, you lose the ability to do
Icarus Ascension and Icarus Strike right after that fateful cutscene at River
Styx, though the rest of your Wings abilities remain. You can get this move back
by using the Godly Possession Aphrodite's Garter, which turns your BoE back to
the Rapid Switch-less BoA.

- As in GoW II, Icarus Ascension "defies gravity", you can do it over chasms
without Kratos falling down.

- The animation of Kratos falling flat on his stomach after gliding too long can
push him through walls if he is in a cramped place. Very hard to do on purpose:
only known chance is at the Poseidon Princess room.

- There's a long jump exploit using Glide. "Double Glide jump". There was a
section about it above, in the jumps section.



Blade of Olympus:

- If you have infinite health, you can run on top of a certain type of
insta-death platform using Rage of Sparta. RoS also allows you to descend
through another type of insta-death platform… useful in rare circumstances.

- The basic Rage of Sparta combo makes Kratos zip forward at very fast speeds.
Before the last strike, his speed rises high enough to make him noticeably sink
into, for example, chests. So far, this observation has not helped in breaching
any walls in the game, though.

- Rage of Sparta can be activated during climbing or rope sections as well, but
it only stays on during the time you are attacking. It helps Kratos to not get
interrupted if enemies attack him, but... it probably doesn't increase the
damage he does.

- Rage of Sparta ends if Kratos runs into a climbing wall.



I. Enemies

Note: for bosses, you're just going to have to browse the level-by-level
listings to see what's written of them. Only normal enemies are included here.


Olympus Archer:
- Can be infinite air grabbed?
- Can be infinite Orion's Harpooned?
- Can be stunned with HoH.
- When combat grappled in air, they keep falling during the entire attack,
unlike the majority of foes in the game.


Olympus Fiend:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be infinite Orion's Harpooned.
- Can be stunned with HoH.
- Their specialty is being very aggressive blockers of all sorts of projectile
attacks.
- During their death attack they can't be targeted or hit.
- Their death attack does not begin in some conditions.
- If Cyclops Berserkers are around, Fiends will actually mount them! This can
only happen at the Combat Arena because these two enemies never meet during the
main game. Unfortunately this mount doesn't have a proper moveset, only the
fireball from the Fiend and one melee attack from the Cyclops. It seems that
this enemy wasn't finished because they knew it wouldn't be seen in the main
game, so there are plenty of glitches to be had during this encounter.

Videos:

Bronze Talos:
- Cestus' combat grapple only works at point blank range.
- Can't be launched.
- Can't be stonefrozen.


Stone Talos:
- Cestus' combat grapple only works at point blank range.
- Can't be launched.
- Can't be stonefrozen.
- Can't be lit on fire.


Centaur General:
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.


Cerberus Mongrel:
- Rideable foe.
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.
- Can be stonefrozen, but only by reflecting a Gorgon's beam. Gorgon Serpent
summon or normal freeze beam will only slow it down, in addition to making its
textures go dull gray.


Hades Cerberus Breeder:
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.
- Can't be stonefrozen.
- In Combat Arena, due to a counterattacking glitch or something similar, he
might start fighting you relentlessly even though his attack is set 'off'.
- In the same conditions, he might get stuck in a strange 'taunt' animation
until you try to approach him.


Chimera:
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.
- Can't be stonefrozen.


Woman of Olympia:
- Very talkative.
- Kratos can bump into them to make them stumble.
- As you may have noticed, during the game civilians utter comments relevant to
the latest plot changes (e.g. about the world growing dark after Helios gets
it).
- Extremely low HP.
- The Claws' Soul Rip souls do not bother to attack this "enemy."
- Nearby enemies sometimes start targeting them instead of Kratos.
- They don't have a spawning animation in Arena, they just suddenly appear.


Olympia Citizen:
- Very talkative.
- Kratos can bump into them to make them stumble.
- As you may have noticed, during the game civilians utter comments relevant to
the latest plot changes (e.g. about the world growing dark after Helios gets
it).
- Extremely low HP.
- The Claws' Soul Rip souls do not bother to attack this "enemy".
- Nearby enemies sometimes start targeting them instead of Kratos.
- They don't have a spawning animation in Arena, they just suddenly appear.


Cyclops Enforcer:
- Cestus' combat grapple only works at point blank range.
- Can't be launched.


Cyclops Berserker:
- Rideable foe.
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.
- While they can’t be launched, some attacks like the triangle finisher from the
Claws of Hades can lift them momentarily. If the Cyclop is in the air when being
grabbed by Kratos, the animation will glitch out, and Kratos will start climbing
in air. Sometimes Kratos drops to the ground as soon as the animation is
finished, but on other occasions he can stay in the air and do fake moves as if
he was controlling the Cyclop.

Cyclops Remains:
- Cestus' combat grapple is repelled.
- Can't be launched.


Olympus Sentry:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be infinite Orion's Harpooned.
- Can be stunned with HoH.
- On rare occasions, these enemies can be seen 'crawling' down on the ground
despite having their legs intact.
- Shielded Sentries can slide around strangely when hit with Nemesis Rage. §
- Shielded Sentries can survive if dropped into water, but only as long as they
have their shields intact. This can be tested at Poseidon's palace.
- In Combat Arena, if you retry, the first Sentry spawns will have glitched
shields on them. The shield can't be broken with Cestus hits, among other
strange things. After that legionnaire dies, the later spawns will have normal
shields again.

Olympus Legionnaire:
- Can be stunned with HoH.
- Same shield glitch in Combat Arena as with Olympus Sentry.


Cursed Remains:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be stunned with HoH.


Harpy:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be infinite Orion's Harpooned.


Harpy Queen:
- Rideable foe. Any weapon's Combat Grapple starts the ride, as do air grabs and
Orion's Harpoon.
- Subject to being 'duplicated' upon being ridden in certain conditions. Read
more about this from the general glitches section at "air grab break out".
- A rare glitch allows Kratos to start riding the Harpy Queen right as it
becomes stonefrozen. It works out like normal, but the Harpy's graphics are
mostly invisible. The Harpy will also permanently unexist this way, meaning that
even the scripted permanently respawning Harpies will cease respawning.
- Also rarely Kratos can break out of riding the Harpy Queen, so that he is
riding with nothing and the flight fizzles out pretty soon.
- At the end of a Harpy ride, any enemies in the vicinity are highlighted, and
if Kratos leaps he will aim towards them. If the enemy he targets is another
Harpy Queen, he starts riding it. Other enemies, Kratos just falls at them and
they get pushed away or even rise up in the air momentarily (looks funny with
the Cyclops for example), but nothing else happens.

Special: flying lessons from Harpy Queen  (c: Magnetro)

There's a bizarre glitch with which you can start riding other enemies than the
Harpy Queen, taking both Kratos and the unsuspecting foe into the skies. The
other enemy won't die after the flight like the Harpy, but the graphical effect
is very cool looking.

To do it, go to the Arena with a Harpy Queen and another enemy. Note that this
doesn't happen with all enemies, see the list below for what works. First do
Claws CG to the other enemy to make souls fly around the place. Have the Harpy
Queen close by so that it gets hit by some souls and falls lower. The Harpy
Queen must be at a certain height for this glitch to work, nearly at the ground
level. Then, while the souls are still buzzing around, do a normal grab to the
Harpy Queen. This should start the glitch.

Enemies you can do this with:
- Olympus Archers
- Olympus Fiends
- Cerberus Mongrel
- Chimera
- Woman of Olympia
- Olympia Citizen
- Cyclops Enforcer
- Olympus Sentry
- Olympus Legionnaire
- Cursed Remains
- Harpy
- Gorgon
- Gorgon Serpent
- Skorpius Spawn
- Minotaur Elite
- Minotaur Brute
- Feral Hound
- Hades Cerberus Whelp
- Satyr
- Siren Seductress
- Lost Soul
- Wraith of Olympus

This list may not be final. It appears harder to do this glitch with some
enemies, and it could be that some glitch opportunity just went unnoticed.

Gorgon:
- Can be manipulated into shooting freeze beams with 'false grabs.'


Gorgon Serpent:
- Cestus' Combat Grapple only works at point blank range.

- If she becomes stonefrozen when she shoots those freezing beams at you, the
beam itself becomes frozen in the process too! Kratos is stonefrozen repeatedly
if he happens to be in the line of fire.


Skorpius Spawn:
- Can be stunned with HoH.


Minotaur Elite:
- Cestus' Combat Grapple yields strange results pretty often. Sometimes the
enemy gets knocked off into a strange direction, sometimes the Grapple becomes
blocked right before Kratos would throw his punch, sometimes the enemy starts
sliding momentarily after the grapple...


Minotaur Brute:
- Cestus' combat grapple yields similar results as with Minotaur Elite.


Labrys Minotaur:
- Cestus' combat grapple yields similar results as with Minotaur Elite.
- Claws' combat grapple is repelled.


Feral Hound:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be stunned with HoH.


Hades Cerberus Whelp:
- Can be infinite air grabbed.
- Can be stunned with HoH.


Satyr:
- Can be briefly stunned with HoH.
- Cestus' combat grapple yields similar results as with Minotaur Elite.
- In a rare glitch witnessed by shinobier, this foe "played dead" by not rising
up after being knocked on its back during the Hell Cerberus Breeder fight.


Olympus Guardian:
- A regular Olympus Sentry behind a shield.
- Their shield blocks all non-Cestus attacks with only a few exceptions (like
Cyclops Berserker riding attacks). They are immune to being lit on fire, stunned
by HoH, grabs, launches... However, they are not immune to being stonefrozen,
and this weakness should be taken advantage of.
- If you die in the Combat Arena, after retry these foes have a glitched shield.
It can't be broken with Cestus hits. You can also grab the enemy despite the
shield being there. Spawns after the first one will have non-glitched shields.
- If they are stonefrozen during the spawning-animation, their shield cannot be
destroyed. This most often happens in the Gorgon elevator fight, where the game
requires them to be killed this way.

Siren Seductress:
- Can be briefly stunned with HoH.
- Can be infinite air grabbed although their mini-game phases will interrupt the
technique.
- When in their ghostly form, they can be glitch hit with Combat Grapples if
they happen to get in the way. They become visible for a moment, and a hit is
registered, though the attack itself doesn't seem to even begin (except with
Claws' air CG, which can even send skulls at them on contact!)


Lost Soul:
- Very talkative.
- Can be stunned with HoH.
- Kratos can bump into them to make them fall down.
- The Claws' Soul Rip souls do not bother to attack Lost Souls.


Wraith of Olympus:
- Can be infinite Orion's Harpooned.
- Can be briefly stunned with HoH.
- It can be stonefrozen while it's burrowing inside the ground. It's very hard
(if even impossible) to shatter the foe like this.
- If you stonefreeze it roughly the same time you pull it out of the ground with
Cestus' combat grapple, it becomes invincible for the duration of the
stonefreeze. No attacks or magics will harm it, which looks pretty eerie.

# Glitch walkthrough
------------------------------------
 
Different markings are used for different entries:
 
- Sequence break (you are able to skip portions of the game)
- Collision flaw (wall, floor, etc. has a noteworthy flaw in it)
- Trigger skip (you are able to skip a loading or another type of trigger)
- Other (a glitch that doesn't fit into any of the other groups)
- Wasted potential (something that doesn't appear to work, unfortunately)
- Strategy (listing some useful tip or strategy)
- Sweet spot (a location which allows strategic advantages)
- Untested (something that no one has tried? wrote it down here)
- Random (some tidbit)


<Main Screen>

Other (NG+): play as Kratos in the main screen

It was originally discovered by Exe during one of his speedrun attempts that
sometimes after setting up NG+ glitch and changing costume, Kratos would
disappear and soon re-appear, completely free to move in the main menu screen.

The glitch is done like this. You have to set up NG+ glitch. Then, after the
game takes you back to the main menu, you can hear two musics playing at once
for a short period of time. The glitch is probably related to this music playing
and stopping at a certain time when you change costume, so try to go and change
Kratos' costume as quickly as possible after being returned to the main menu.
Then, it seems that for the glitch to start you have to select Fear Kratos as
your costume and then start tapping circle as quickly as possible. It's not 100%
reliable, but sometimes you get this glitch to happen.

So what can be done in these unique circumstances? Well, the map of the main
menu is basically just a small island that doesn't seem to have any triggers
around it. You can run some steps to any direction, but after that the ground
ends and Kratos falls down to his doom. Most of Kratos' move list is intact in
the main menu - however, you cannot switch your selected Gear, do Soul Summon or
activate RoS. Weapon quick-switching is also disabled in favor of being able to
operate the main menu with the d-pad.

What happens if you die in the main menu? You get the usual death menu that asks
you to either retry or quit. Retrying takes you back to the main menu at the
start of having just activated NG+ glitch. You can again hear the two musics
playing at the same time and NG+ glitch remains activated. Choosing to quit also
takes you back to the main menu, but this time the NG+ glitch is over and
everything is back to normal again.

Starting a New Game, Kratos becomes locked in the usual animation after which
the first cutscene of the game starts. If you're falling, Kratos enters the
animation while falling and dies after hitting the bottom, interrupting the
sequence. If you have infinite health on, the game will softlock instead when
the cutscene interrupts and Kratos is stuck in the bottomless pit. It might
cause some new glitches if you could die just before the new game intro started,
but we would need more height and better jump techniques for this to happen.

If you start a New Game after dying and as the screen is blacking out, the New
Game sequence interrupts and you enter an invisible 'retry / quit'-menu while a
slightly glitched horizon fills the background. You are forced to choose either,
and after that things go on as normal. Trying to start a New Game while touching
death floor with infinite health on causes a softlock like mentioned above.

Trying to load a game after dying is not useful since the death menu overrides
the load game-menu and it never opens up. §

Trying to switch costumes locks the camera to the opposite direction of where
Kratos was facing and also forces Kratos to stand still, effectively ending the
part of the glitch where you are free to move. It's possible to die while
changing costumes, but so far this hasn't produced very interesting effects. §

You can watch those bonus videos like Making of God of War III as Kratos dies.
This causes another unique effect where the 'retry / quit'-menu stays in the
background as you watch a cinematic. The cinematic itself also lacks audio in
this situation. Retrying in the middle of a cinematic causes it to interrupt
instantly and you are taken back to the main menu, everything seemingly back to
normal.

If you exit the cinematic or watch it all the way through, you return back to
the main menu with the retry menu controls still working in the background all
this time. You are able to do some other strange variations here like retry
while trying to load a game - the load game menu refuses to open all the way
through and you basically have to choose either retry or quit to continue.
Starting a New Game doesn't work out either since time is currently stopped
thanks to the retry menu. The New Game sequence never starts properly, and you
are stuck again until you choose either retry or quit. Trying to switch costumes
is fairly anti-climactic too since you never see Kratos nor does the camera move
while operating the menu.

Retrying while loading another cinematic causes the game to load longer than
usual, then you're taken back to the main menu again. §

There are also some unique glitch variations if you're fast enough, like
starting a New Game before Kratos re-materializes after changing costumes. This
way the New Game sequence does not begin at all and Kratos remains stranded on
the small main menu island forever.

After disappearing, if you haven't exited the costume menu yet and suddenly
switch back to normal Kratos, you are able to use this glitch with the normal
costume. It allows a few new variations, such as entering the Arena or
Challenges during the glitch. However, this is such a rare variation that it
hasn't been tested yet. §

Other: costumes becoming glitched

Dying and retrying in the main menu also causes a curious glitch where your
costumes become glitched up. The game displays Kratos' normal skin while
claiming that it is in fact the Fear Kratos-costume. Starting a New Game takes
this glitched costume with you and your trophies are automatically disabled
although you look just like normal Kratos. It's not verified yet if this
glitched skin works like normal or Fear Kratos. §

Also, trying to switch from glitched Fear Kratos costume back to normal Kratos
never works out. The game will softlock as it spends an eternity trying to load
Kratos his normal skin back. You could interpret it as Kratos becoming stuck in
his own wardrobe indefinitely. A pitiful end for a Spartan warrior!

<In-Game Menus and Photo Mode>

Buffering inputs to happen inside Photo Mode (c: findlestick):

This is a Remastered-only glitch since the original game didn't have Photo Mode.

Some actions can be buffered to happen while you're inside, or after exiting,
the Photo Mode-screen. To do this, you must have the 'Camera'-tab selected
inside the Photo Mode-screen, beforehand. It won't work otherwise.

Here's a list of some actions that can be buffered, and their effects.
- Jump: keep X held-down before entering Photo Mode (Kratos can be on the ground
or in air during this). Kratos will automatically jump while inside the Photo
Mode-screen. With this, it might be possible to force Kratos to jump at a time
that he shouldn't be able to (i.e as a cutscene starts, etc?). Needs more
testing… §

- Double-jump: do some ground-attack (at least) while keeping X held-down, then
enter Photo Mode before the attack-animation is over. By keeping X held-down
when you exit Photo Mode, Kratos will automatically do a Double-jump, even
though you only pressed jump once.

- Options-button (Weapons-menu): keep the Options-button held-down as you enter
Photo Mode, then release the Options-button. When you exit Photo Mode, the game
will automatically open the Weapons-menu. Buffering the Weapons-menu in this
manner lets you activate prompts during the time that you exit Photo Mode, and
when the game automatically enters the Weapons-menu.

Doing the above lets you (at least) activate a Savepoint-prompt as the game
enters the Weapons-menu. Note that this is more reliable to do if you also keep
L1 held-down, or if you’re attacking as you enter Photo Mode, during the setup.
Now you have the Savepoint buffered while you are in the Weapons-menu. Since the
Savepoint is buffered, you can actually enter Photo Mode as soon as you exit the
Weapons-menu (and possibly the Pause-menu?), just before the Save-menu appears.
This results in having Photo Mode active, behind the Save-menu!

All this needs thorough testing. It would be interesting to do this with the
Pause-menu, to see if you can restart, quit the game, etc. while the Save-menu
is on-screen. Might it be possible to take the Save-menu to the Main-menu? §


Entering menus as a cutscene starts (PS4-only?):

Entering a menu at the same time that a cutscene starts can give slightly
varying results depending on the location that you do this. Here's some common
results, specifics will be outlined at the Level-by-level glitches around the
FAQ:

- The cutscene keeps playing while you're inside the menu, so it’s possible to
save time during a NG speedrun by utilizing this idle-time to enter the
Weapons-menu and upgrade your gear.

- If the cutscene plays without audio, and you then restart, the audio will play
twice at the same time, but extremely out-of-sync with each other. Quitting the
game will keep the audio playing in the Main Screen or in any New Game that you
load, overlaid with other audio that might be playing. You can even take the
audio into the Combat Arena, bonus videos, etc... it will keep playing
pretty-much anywhere. Once the audio ends, the glitch ends harmlessly.

- Time keeps running while you're inside the Weapon-menu (and the Pause-menu?)
during a cutscene, but commonly stops as soon as the cutscene ends.

- If you're in a menu when a cutscene ends, the menu will have graphical
glitches or will have some, or all graphics missing. You can sometimes see the
actual game in the background when scrolling between the Weapons-menu-tabs.

Being in a menu when the cutscene ends, also forces the game to keep Kratos at
the location that the cutscene started, until you exit the menu. This glitch is
used to create a custom checkpoint at the River Styx (see the River Styx section
for more info). This could have more glitch potential around the game. (c:
findlestick)
 

<Gaia>

Other: if you load the auto-save created at Gaia from the main menu, the screen
won't turn black as usual when the game starts loading. Instead you see the main
menu screen for many seconds as it slowly starts to unload. After that things go
back to normal.

 
Other (NG+): if you change weapons right after the first cinematic ends, the
Blade of Olympus that Kratos brandishes may turn invisible in the following
cutscene.

Skip / wasted potential: first fight skip
 
The first room can be easily left with Jet Dash if you're playing on NG+.
Crooked parts of the walls around the back side of the room can give you the
necessary height boost to get over walls. The pathway on which the first boss
fight begins will be almost completely horizontal when you reach there, but once
you climb it up, the boss fight cutscene activates and everything continues like
it normally would.

You can also leave the first room on NG by doing an Icarus Ascension to the left
of the burning log, at a specific time, so that Kratos slides on some angled
collision and falls behind the wall, from where he can Glide past the burning
log.

An alternative way to leave the area on NG is to do some Icarus Ascension near
the log right as soon as the game starts for the first time. This sometimes
causes a checkpoint glitch that causes Kratos to hover in the air in t-pose upon
retry. After floating a while, you can Glide past the burning log. If you don't
get it to work, you have to start a New Game to try it again.
(c: findlestick)

If you proceed with the game, the last phase of the boss fight is cut off with
the cinematic that would normally begin after the first fight. On PS3,
unfortunately, the game crashes after the misplaced cutscene plays for a few
seconds, making the skip a wasted potential. On PS4, the trick does work without
the game crashing, enabling a small timesave.

3, Jolielegal’s video of this skip using Jet Dash on NG+ (PS4):
        https://youtu.be/LB7JnWDOXxw


Untested: what would happen if you jumped over the log, killed the last enemy in
the first room, then activated Hippocampus' entrance scene right before the
cinematic begins? You'd need to delay the last sentry's death somehow, by
shooting it with a burning arrow, or an Olympus Archer-soul, maybe?


Other: If you are out-of-bounds to the left of the very first 'room', you can
Jet Dash to Gaia's left wrist/hand. It has a full walkable collision that has an
empty "metallic" sounding collision when Kratos runs around on it. You can even
do horizontal grapple climbing inside of Gaia's curled palm and fingers.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5loAPvalXpw#t=169


Out of bounds (NG): another way to go out of bounds after the burning log was
found by Vipeazone. After moving the log, do some rolls to forward and stay next
to the right wall while doing it. Once the new checkpoint activates, loading it
can drop Kratos on some floor out of bounds.

You can reach the boss from out of bounds this way, and also explore the nearby
area closer than the devs wanted you to. There is for instance a strange glowing
orb inside Gaia if you drop down inside her body. Also, if you're still out of
bounds as the boss arena turns upside down, Kratos seems to fall down to his
doom.

<Hippocampus>
 
Wasted glitch potential (NG+): You can skip the Hippocampus battle trigger by
doing a high jump into Jet Dash against the invisible wall of collision that
traps you once you cross it. This lifts you up high, and by going left or right
you can get out of bounds and walk around on lots of walkable collision.
 
You can then walk up to Gaia's hand without Hippocampus there (from slightly
out-of-bounds), from there you can Jet Dash to an area that looks like the
grapple wall you come to later, but it has no collision. (Untested: Getting to
this grapple wall at other phases of Hippocampus).
 
 
Other: backtracking during Hippocampus fight

Trigger the Hippocampus fight from out of bounds, then damage Hippocampus until
it makes Gaia's arm turn over to the climbing phase. If you do this, you can
actually grapple climb all the way back to the very start of Gaia. All the while
you see Hippocampus unload (except for its breath). When you get to the start of
Gaia, Kratos keeps switching from being invisible to visible very suddenly, and
the whole first Gaia room looks (graphically) like a completely differently
designed area.

<Mount Olympus>
 
Sequence break (NG+): using high jump and Dash, you can get over the wall before
the first ledge shimmying part. From there you can skip using the ledge shimmy
as well as a cutscene and some enemies. Later on, Gaia herself may be mostly
invisible - perhaps a part of her data never became loaded.

Wasted glitch potential (NG+): it's possible to reach the chain with Jet Dash,
etc. but it's just a cardboard cut-out and nothing's actually there.
 
Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuy0c9Tfk6s


Skip (NG and NG+): you can skip the grapple point intro by doing Jet Dash from
the ground level to the next ledge. In normal New Game this scene is also
skippable: climb the ledge near the grapple point from as left as possible, so
that you can R1 the grapple right before the scene activates.


Sequence break (NG and NG+): you can use a Sky Jump after the first grapple
point to reach the upper level early. Basically, after using the grapple point,
start Gliding towards the back-right corner of the upcoming ledge. It's pretty
luck-reliant, but you can sometimes hit a part of the ledge that sends Kratos
high in the air and to the upper level early. This works on both NG and NG+ (c:
findlestick).

To load Ares' tomb, you have to hit a loading zone near where you'd normally
climb up to the higher level. Hitting the cutscene trigger with Gaia is not
necessary.

a part of the climb up the mountain ridge. (c: findlestick)

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAz0pAbVSZ8


Wasted glitch potential (NG+): By doing combinations of high jump and Jet Dash
from the left of the broken climbing ladder, you can do an elaborate skip
directly underneath the bridge that Hippocampus destroys later on.

First do Jet Ascension from as left as possible to end up on some walkable
collision near the climbing wall. From there another SJ jump with Jet Dashing to
the right leads you to some more walkable collision higher up. And with one
final SJ jump and Dashing you end up inside the crevice under the bridge.

This would be a good speedrun strategy if it was not for the fact that you skip
the trigger that loads Ares' tomb, getting you stuck.

Other: By Skipping specific triggers on your way to the climbing ledge, you get

Skip (NG+): you can skip the cutscene of the pathway being crushed by doing a
high jump and then Dashing at top height over the area. This is pretty hard to
do in my opinion with a Severe Judgment jump alone. (c: AKheon)

<Tomb of Ares>
 
Sequence break (NG+): you can do a high jump and grab a ledge at the top of the
large door that leads you to Tomb of Ares, and from there jump outside bounds.
 
Those who have mastered the Jet Dash are able to jump from on top of the door
straight to the platform with the save point. At first it doesn't look like
anything is loaded behind the door, but if you run back towards the save and
return, Gaia should have appeared like normal. (c: AKheon)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aKeHrsZ4FQ


Other (NG+): If you enter the Tomb with the door closed, during the Centaur
cutscene you can hear hooves clopping behind the closed door, but no one will
enter... Yes, the Centaur gets stuck outside the room. You can attempt to fight
it like this, but if he tries to do the dash QTE attack on Kratos, the game may
freeze for unknown reasons.

Skip (NG+): an easier way to skip the whole switch-pulling ordeal is to high
jump from on top of the ladder platform and from there Jet Dash towards the
other end of the area. You can easily grab a ledge there and then merrily
continue on your way. (c: AKheon)
 
You can also skip pulling the lever by doing a vertical Ladder Jump followed by
a horizontal Ladder Jump to cross the gap. But this is extremely difficult to do
because you have to rely on luck to be able to do a horizontal Ladder Jump after
a vertical one.

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvJbybqsMSg


Skip (NG): you can pull the switch while ignoring the Centaur if you're lucky.
If you have the Centaur smash headfirst into the wall, he will be stunned a
moment, and this is usually enough to pull the switch.

Wasted potential (NG+): it's possible to Sorrow Jump over the edge of the save
room, and from there Jet Dash to multiple locations. Returning outside is
possible, but you can't do anything there but play around with the Centaur that
was left behind the door (if you spawned him) or just return back upstairs. Jet
Dashing beyond the gate to the right is novel, but not too useful, it seems. You
can't R1 the gate from the wrong side, nor can you access the next fight like
this. If you want, you can walk down from the ledge and Jet Dash a bit forward,
reaching a climbing wall that doesn't lead you anywhere. (c: AKheon)

<Hippocampus part deux>
 
Random (NG+): projectile attacks have immense troubles hitting this boss.
 
 
Wasted potential (NG+): you can exit the battlefield by Jet Dashing while the
boss is stunned. This is because the back wall of the arena becomes angled while
the boss is stunned, which allows you Jet Ascend out of the room, although it is
difficult. But there is nowhere in particular where you can go from here? You
can see a bit of the Gaia's innard area beneath Hippocampus, but there is no
collision or loading points.


Sequence break (skip scene of landing in Gaia):

After killing the Hippocampus, you can rarely jump into Gaia’s chest without
triggering the intro scene of Kratos landing. It is very inconsistent to do, and
we don’t understand exactly why it happens. It seems to occur more often if you
climb using attacks.

<Heart of Gaia>
 
Skip (NG+): with Sorrow Jump, you can go outside bounds from the first room.
First, hit a loading trigger at the shimmy. Then try doing a Sorrow Jump over
the hole you dropped into the area from. With a good height and angle, you can
then begin Jet Dashing and drop Kratos directly into the Heart of Gaia area. (c:

Speed Strategy (NG+): it’s possible to skip the Heart of Gaia cutscene while
still loading the next area. It’s done by hitting the ground in a way that
triggers the next area of the level, but without triggering the scene.

To do it, land on the edge of the platform from the area that oversees Heart of
Gaia. Then Jet Dash to the back of the room. (c: Jolielegal)

Skip (NG+): you can skip the block pushing puzzle by climbing to the platform
that has Zeus' Eagle and from there Jet Dashing over the chasm. Or, even faster,
you can Jet Dash against the back wall beneath the climbing vines to Jet Ascend
all the way up to the vines.


Skip (NG): there are two ways to speed things up in this section on NG. First is
that you don't push the climbing wall block all the way into its allotted slot.
This way you skip a small cutscene that normally begins afterwards, but can
still climb the climbing wall as normal.

Another, even faster way to beat this section is to pull out the block 4 - 5
meters from the right wall without turning it. Then double jump and glide onto
the block from the right climbing wall, climb near the top of the block, then
double jump and glide to the climbing wall to the left. (c: vipeazone)

Wasted skip potential (NG+): the "impenetrable substance" around Gaia's heart
cannot be interacted at this time, even if you have Gauntlets with you. Even if
you go over it using Jest Jump, so that you get a direct contact to the side of
the heart, you can do absolutely nothing to it.

Wasted potential (NG+): I'd like to try accessing the next grapple point out of
bounds, bypassing the climbing bit and possibly some triggers. But the walls are
extremely high on the walkway with soldiers. Well, to be honest, I did succeed
in it using JJ and bow height gain, but I can't remember the results being too
remarkable.


Speed strategy? (NG+): you can skip a part of the climbing wall by doing a high
jump and Jet Dashing into the wall. Might save a negligible amount of time.


Wasted Glitch Potential (NG+) Skipping Poseidon’s intro cutscene:

By using the grapple that takes you onto Gaia, during a Death collision jump,
you break-out of climbing on her head. From there it’s possible to Jet Dash
directly to the swing-grapple on her hand to trigger the next phase early. Then,
the full scene plays where Gaia is supposed to be grabbing Poseidon, but with
Poseidon absent. When the scene is over, Kratos is unable to proceed from Gaia’s
hand, as Poseidon is also absent from that phase of the battle.
(c: findlestick)

It’s unknown if anything would happen if you reached the area before Ares’ Tomb
at this point. §


<Poseidon>

Random: Camera during Poseidon fight can be messed up by some unknown factor,
making it hard to read his attacks.


Other (NG+): if you leave the fighting area, you can backtrack and go back to
climb down Gaia's head. Due to the skewed angle this looks weird, as if Kratos
was climbing on air. Kratos also turns to climb upside down momentarily.

Speed strategy? (NG+): Skip 1st part of Poseidon fight

At the start of the fight, you can easily leave the area by doing a combination
of Jet Ascension and Jet Dash. If you then Jet Dash to around Poseidon's back,
you can R1 the grapple point that is hidden there, and that will throw you
directly to Phase 2 of Poseidon. But it might not save any time, especially
because the Phase 1 is very short on NG+. (c: findlestick)

Out of bounds: there's a collision flaw that lets Kratos fall through the floor
at the higher area when you're fighting vs Poseidon up close and personal. It's
on the left side, soon after having climbed up.

as a result of the level's ambient movement.

Cutscene skip (NG+): early final Poseidon scene
 
You can Jet Dash directly from the 1st Poseidon battle to the Entrance to Ares
Tomb (with the help of infinite health glitch, RoS and Hermes’ Boots to fall
down faster). The final Poseidon is already there waiting to be mini-gamed even
though you never fought the earlier phases of the boss fight. You can brutally
finish him off, but nothing happens afterwards, not even his death cinematic. If
you then go to the hole that Gaia's finger should be in, the game will load the
complete cutscene with Gaia and Zeus. But after that, the Hades section does not
load. You just get a blank screen and you can hear Kratos moving around in
nothingness.
 
If you save using the save point nearby after killing Poseidon and then restart,
you end up back at the Poseidon 1 fight. Should you now deal with all the phases
of the fight like normal, strange things happen after the cinematic in which
Poseidon is thrown against the. For one, Poseidon is absent from the whole area.
The scene of Kratos interrogating him takes place from a distance, with dialogue
mostly quiet, and the ensuing finisher QTE never takes place because Kratos
cannot mini-game something that isn't there...
 
However, if you now go over to where Gaia's finger should be (it's still not
there), the Gaia cutscene starts, but with Gaia totally absent from it. After
some strange graphical glitches, the next cutscene returns to normal (Gaia
visible again). And then the rest of the game loads normally.
 
So, to sum up this strange series of events, the cinematic in which Poseidon
dissolves and the lands become flooded are skipped. If you could reach the final
Poseidon scene under 45 secs (approx. length of the skipped cutscene) time would
be won. But it's not an easy task, since it's difficult to control Jet Dash
during this bit.
 
Later Findlestick found out that it's far easier to do this skip during the last
phase of the Poseidon fight because you can control your flight better (due to
less ambient movement in the level). You should Jet Dash from the cliff right
before the long grapple sequence, or use a checkpoint exploit to end up on top
of one of the grapples (read more below) and Jet Dash from there.

Other (NG+): Nemesis Rage bolts have immense difficulties physically hitting
this boss. This is true for Poseidon himself when you are in the second part of
the fight. It seems this low accuracy thing is true for all projectile weapons -
after all, you are not supposed to have them at this point yet.


Other (NG+): During the "O" bashing minigame on Poseidon's giant form, you can
switch weapons between each hit. It looks silly, that's all.


Other / Cutscene skip (NG+?): if you restart from the last checkpoint while you
are on Gaia's head (at the grapples), and then spam R1 as the game is loading,
Kratos will break out from the grapple and he will appear standing directly on
top of the grapple once the game has loaded. From there it is possible to
Alt-Jet Dash to the final Poseidon, this is the quickest way to get to him in
order to skip the cutscene - later on - where he dissolves. (So this is also a
possible speedrun strategy IF done quickly enough).
 
Breaking out from the grapple also causes it to malfunction, you can then R1
that 1st grapple endlessly, causing Kratos to loop his swinging animation.

Other: The timing for the final grapple point is very lenient. If you press R1
after the prompt is already gone and you visibly missed it, the game registers
it as success and Kratos is suddenly teleported on top of the claw.
 
 
Other (NG+): If you have infinite health, even if you miss the final prompt of
the Grapple sequence, the next cutscene of Gaia punching Poseidon will still be
triggered as if you never missed it. The scenes with Poseidon after that don't
start properly, though, since the game won't transport Kratos out of the
bottomless pit he has well sunken into by then.
 
 
<Entrance to Ares Tomb>
 
Other (NG+): If you go to the final Poseidon early, you can hurt him enough that
he gets the mini-game circle rotating over his head. If you then save and reload
to return back to an earlier point in time, the circle will be visible all the
way through the very serious cutscene where Kratos talks to Poseidon.
 
 
Other: sparing Poseidon... almost
 
When it's time to finish off Poseidon, you can't move an inch. The only thing
you can do is 'grab', and we all know what happens after that. However, if you
retry from the last checkpoint and jump away from Poseidon the instant gameplay
continues, you can reach the nearby save point and create a new checkpoint.
After another retry, Kratos can move completely freely instead of being forced
to walk. But none of this will change Poseidon's fate, since Gaia intentionally
keeps from showing up until the resounding snap of the unlucky Olympian's neck
is heard.

Other: glitching Poseidon's death QTE
 
Do a high jump towards the wall behind Poseidon, and you can grab a secret ledge
and end up behind collision. You can do various kinds of displaced QTEs from
there. It's the easiest to grab the ledge by doing a Severe Judgment jump, but
even "slightly higher double jump" is enough.

Other (NG+): Poseidon is a special target who only gets hits from some attacks.
Interestingly, unlike many other subdued Olympians, he can be targeted with
Combat Grapples. Haven't found a way to move him around the room, though.
 
 
Other (NG+): When you press L3+R3 to gouge Poseidon's eyes out, Rage will be
activated. You can turn it off-and-on again.
 
 
Speed strategy (NG+): If you hit the trigger that makes Gaia's finger move while
you are out of bounds, you set up a glitch that makes Kratos automatically break
free from his weakened state when he reaches River Styx. It's possible that it
isn't enough to be just out of bounds - you may have to be falling and hitting
death collision (with infinite health) for this breakout to happen.
(c: findlestick)

There are other and better methods of breaking out of River Styx, though, listed
below.

Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFW4IhH-XKM


Other: Gaia's Finger Break-out (NG only?):

It's possible to regain control of Kratos once he's on Gaia's finger as she has
started to lift him. Start by Double-jumping from the ground, to the highest
point on her finger, then mash ‘X’ while leaning the L-controller towards Gai.
If done correctly, you'll be able to move Kratos again as Gaia goes up the
mountain. Immediately jump away from Gaia or Kratos will be stuck again. This is
not too difficult to do on NG, but I couldn't get it to work on NG+.

Here's a list of some things you can do before Gaia triggers the cutscene with
Zeus:

-Activating the Savepoint at the same moment that the Zeus cutscene starts: the
cutscene will keep playing while the save-menu is open in the foreground. You
can scroll through the save-menu until you reach the River Styx, at which point
you will no longer see the cutscene in the background. Instead, Kratos will be
standing in the background of the Save-menu, at the Mount Olympus Savepoint.

Saving the game while at the River Styx, will checkpoint you at the Mount
Olympus savepoint, and then restarting will replay the Zeus Cutscene. Opening
the Pause-menu will pause the game, but the Zeus cutscene audio will continue
playing. Returning to the game causes the audio to play twice, extremely
out-of-sync.

Alternatively, if you decide not to save over a previous save-file, Kratos will
appear at the River Styx. Gameplay is normal except for that the Zeus cutscene
audio can be heard overlapping with all other audio at River Styx. When the
cutscene’s audio track ends, everything returns to normal.

Quitting the game now keeps the Zeus cutscene audio playing in the Main Menu or
in the new game that you loaded, overlayed with any other audio that might be
playing. You can even take the cutscene’s audio into a New Game, Combat Arena,
bonus videos... it will keep playing pretty much anywhere. Once the audio ends,
the glitch ends.

Alternatively, if you had entered the Save-menu without navigating any further
prompts asking if you want to save-over a save-file, exiting the Save-menu
restarts the audio track while the cutscene is paused on a single frame. When
the audio catches-up to the point in the cutscene that it should be playing, the
audio and cutscene will sync again.

-Falling out-of-bounds / dying: you'll hear Kratos grunt like when he dies, but
you don't get a Game Over-screen. The game will keep showing Gaia going up the
mountain and she’ll trigger the Zeus cutscene. This whole time you can't enter
any of the menus except for the Photo Mode. When the cutscene ends, the whole
screen goes white and you will hear Kratos die. Now you will hear 'menu-sounds'
if you move the L-controller up or down. You are most likely in a Game
Over-screen because selecting one option restarts you at the Mount Olympus
Savepoint, and the other option quits the game. (c: findlestick)


<River Styx>

Wasted Potential?: Custom Checkpoint at River Styx (NG only?):

At the start of the River Styx, the game checkpoints Kratos once he's already in
the water. But it's possible to create a custom checkpoint so that Kratos, is
instead, checkpointed as he's falling from higher than the walls surrounding the
River.

To do this, break-out of Gaia's finger at the previous level (as described
above, at the section titled: "Gaia's Finger Break-out"), then activate the
Mount Olympus Savepoint before Gaia triggers the Zeus cutscene. Enter the
Pause-menu at the same moment that the Zeus cutscene starts, so that the
cutscene is still playing while you're in the Pause-menu. Being inside the menu
forces the game to keep Kratos at the Mount Olympus Savepoint during the first
moments of the River Styx. Once the cutscene ends, you'll see Kratos standing at
the Mount Olympus Savepoint, with the Pause-menu still in the foreground (or
sometimes just a white screen). To create this custom checkpoint at the River
Styx, exit the Pause-menu and immediately press R1 to use the Mount Olympus
Savepoint. You have now created a custom checkpoint when Kratos is falling from
very high-up at the River Styx.

Having a custom Checkpoint so high-up in the River Styx might allow a New
Game-skip of the River by buffering a jump after a restart and possibly gliding
out-of-bounds over the walls of the River Styx. But so far, the game crashes if
you manage to break-out of Kratos' falling-state. §
(c: findlestick)


Other: River Styx break-out

There are multiple ways to break out of Kratos' weakened state at River Styx.
First method that was discovered for doing this required a precise jump while
retrying from the last checkpoint at the start of River Styx. Trying to jump
manually is nearly frame precise and rather difficult, but it's also possible to
buffer a jump by pressing X right as you open the Pause-menu to retry. This
allows you to consistently make Kratos jump as the screen is fading in. Once
you've done this, Kratos has broken out of the weakened state and can swim at a
normal pace in addition to being able to jump, etc. This allows you to not only
complete this part slightly faster, but all the power draining scenes also look
pretty funny if you enter them while airborne. To note, the triggers for these
scenes are so high that so far there is no way to simply high jump over them.
(c: AKheon)

When you reach walkable ground, Kratos has a tendency to revert back to the
weakened state, but you can prevent it by either blocking or keeping a combo of
some sort up. Another way is to quickly let go of block when near the book and
then R1 it - this allows Kratos to revert to normal permanently for this short
stretch of time before the Athena cutscene.
 
There also exists another way to break out of Kratos' weakened state here. When
the ramp to higher ground begins, hug the right side of the wall and attempt to
do some L1-special. Eventually Kratos will do it due to a collision flaw, and if
you keep blocking afterwards you get to keep the non-weakened state
indefinitely. BUT: remember that while this method is reliable and fast, you
MUST retry after reaching near or beyond the Gorgon fight arena or else the game
will crash when approaching the upcoming bramble wall. An unfortunate side
effect of the trick.

There's a video of one more break-out method, but I haven't tried it myself, so
there's a chance that this description isn't very accurate. To me it looks like
the player hits the collision flaw, then re-enters the water, then holds R-stick
when leaving the water again. § (c: vipeazone)

Other (NG+): skipping parts of River Styx

After having broken out of River Styx, if you sideways Jet Dash angled towards
the walls as the souls latch onto Kratos, he may clip through and go
out-of-bounds. This can be done with the first souls that grab Kratos, skipping
almost the entire river. Unfortunately it is not very consistent to perform, and
a bit of luck may be required. (c: Ragnell)

Another, much slower tactic is to sideways Jet Dash towards the walls of the
River in a very specific way so that the Dash lasts too long and Kratos dies -
this allows doing a death jump, which can get you enough height to reach out of
bounds. From there it's possible to swim out of bounds and Dash to escape the
area early. (c: findlestick)

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5KfJUJoKJ8
 
 
Other (NG+): if you land onto a spot of ground that activates Kratos' weakened
state while holding Bow, Head or Boots active (easy to do using the above
collision flaw), Kratos' state switches to a sort of combination between the
two. He moves very slow and pants while holding Bow, Head or Boots out. He can
do attacks with them, in some cases reverting to normal and in some cases back
to weakened again. You often lose the ability to turn while in the weakened
mix-up state. Switching from Bow to Head (or vice-versa) in the middle of an
attack or even letting go of L2 may cause the game to crash. You can walk into
the Athena cutscene in this state too, but nothing too weird seems to happen.

Sequence break (NG+): skipping Blades of Exile
 
You can jump over the trigger that begins the cutscene in which you chat with
Athena for about 2 minutes and get Blades of Exile. Saves a lot of time in a NG+
run! As a drawback, you are permanently stuck with the weaker Blades of Athena.
(c: AKheon)

To note, the game will eventually give you the BoE anyway right before you face
off final Zeus. So these Blades cannot be entirely skipped after all.

Swimming glitch (NG+): start swimming glitch at River Styx
 
Yes, it's possible to gain an usable swimming glitch from River Styx even
without Hades' Soul. It turns out that the weakened swimming style Kratos starts
in helps bypass the unfortunate water surface property that rockets you skywards
if you try swimming out of bounds.
 
First, you have to skip the Athena cutscene for this to work. After that, jump
back towards the River Styx from the first grapple point and Jet Dash. You will
end outside bounds but swimming. Kratos should return to the original weakened
swimming style, and then you can just leave like normal, except... well, the
weakened swimming style can't be controlled very well, and it's really slow.
What to do? Well, swim far enough to activate a grapple point, voila. Until
then, enjoy the drunken camera that follows Kratos as he desperately swims
through the skies.

Note that you can't take the weakened swimming style very far into the game. If
you don't cancel out of it into normal swimming mode using a grapple point, you
will rocket towards the skies as soon as you go deep enough into Realm of Hades
and the 'idle' swimming stance is loaded.
 
While it is possible to get back into the River Styx outside bounds and start
swimming on NG as well, it's impossible to skip the Athena cutscene before it.
As a result, you can't get back into the weakened swimming stance and it's
impossible to do anything with the swimming glitch than skyrocket into the air.

Other (NG+): severe swimming glitch side effects

Findlestick discovered that if you become checkpointed while in the weakened
swimming state, retrying and pressing X on the first frame causes Kratos to
break out of the special swimming animation, allowing him to do a swim dash.
This leaves Kratos in a special swimming state that has some severe side
effects.

(An alternative way to do this is to first break out of weakened swimming with a
grapple point for instance, then touch death collision. This reverts Kratos to
broken out weakened swimming. §)

While in this special mode, the swim dash does not work like norma, and doing it
repeatedly will in fact cause some bizarre system-level effects in the game.
Doing 30 hard dashes causes Kratos to transform into a vertical pole of bubbles.

While in bubbles mode, getting hit causes an absurd amount of blood to fly out
and Kratos' movement is somewhat limited. You can also keep causing additional
extreme glitch effects by trying to dash even more. Alternatively, ending the
glitched state is also possible by using a grapple point.

If you dash an additional 10-15 very lightly as bubbles, most of the level,
including all character graphics and Kratos himself, becomes entirely dark.
Kratos also loses his Blades. It's possible to end the bubbles glitch now and
continue playing the game as this new "nega-Kratos", but a bit tricky too,
because switching weapons and using some other actions too ends most of the
glitch effects. And you also don't have Blades, preventing you from beating
Hades at the moment.

If you still dash hard an additional 5-7 times after doing all of the above, the
game becomes highly laggy and the camera becomes "decalibrated", i.e. it no
longer focuses on Kratos, and it's almost impossible to continue playing. You
can also press R1 to save for some reason, even if you're not physically close
to a save point, and doing it causes a glitched save that always brings you back
to this bizarre moment in time.

The later variations have a side effect which findlestick calls "non-Kratos"
glitch. If you quit the game now, Kratos is absent from the main menu. Entering
various game modes also causes different side effects while "non-Kratos" is
active.

Trying to start a new game with non-Kratos causes Kratos to appear back in the
game, but it's still highly laggy and Kratos can fall through walls without
warning while in this state. The camera also doesn't work like it should.

Entering the combat arena as non-Kratos causes similar results. Lighting may not
work properly, the camera definitely doesn't work properly and Kratos can walk
through walls.

You might get different results when doing all the above if you start
"bubbles"-mode with different weapons equipped, different costumes on or at a
different location. It's a very convoluted glitch, and testing is still
underway...  (c: findlestick)

<Realm of Hades>

Other: getting early Regen Magic (c: findlestick)

In February 2021, it was confirmed by findlestick that by triggering the Army of
Sparta tutorial, and staying beyond the arena's boundary, lets you proceed with
regenerating magic while also skipping the Army of Sparta tutorial.

Unlike the regenerating magic glitch at the Soul-Summon tutorial, this one lets
you keep weapon-switching. So during a New Game speedrun, it's recommended that
you don't trigger the Soul-Summon tutorial when you get to it (via swimming
glitch), in order to keep regenerating magic, as well as the ability to switch
weapons.

This skip is done by double-jumping and gliding along the battle arena's left
side, glide and barely touch the side of the arena to start a Double-glide long
jump so that you trigger the arena, but while ending-up beyond the barrier that
rises as the Army of Sparta battle starts.

For some reason it seems that doing this skip while swimming (using the River
Styx swimming glitch), it isn't possible to load the next area. Maybe this
should be tried again at some point? §

Sequence break / wasted potential: skipping much of the Realm of Hades
 
If you activate a trigger inside the corridor leading back to Realm of Hades
from the direction of the rotating room, you can load Hades' Palace early and
skip most of the activities in Hades. This is very easy to do on NG+ runs, and
is often used in runs that don’t utilize the Early Chain Break glitch: just use
one of the grapple points to gain height, Jet Dash to the balcony where there's
the Pandora statue, backtrack a little and come back. Voila. (c: AKheon)

On NG, while you CAN get to this area early by using an ambitious Sky Jump, the
skip is not useful because you miss out on the Bow this way and cannot complete
the game.

Wasted glitch potential: Early Hephaestus visit
 
By Jet Dashing to the brambles that are near the rotating room, you can reach
Hephaestus early. Unfortunately nothing comes from doing it at this date except
a humorous glitch where you get a cutscene of Kratos talking to an absent
Hephaestus. Making it look like he has lost his marbles... a recurring theme in
this game. (Glitchwise that is!) (c: findlestick)

Fight skip (NG+): you can skip the short scene of Hades talking and the Army of
Sparta fight by Jet Dashing to the next platform.


Sequence Break (NG): skip first Gorgon fight

To do this skip, you need to drop-and-glide from the rope that leads to the
large, arched platform. Land on the platform's edge and navigate along that edge
towards some solid collision that you can stand on, located out-of-bounds,
behind the Orbs-chests.

From there, Double-glide long jump out-of-bounds towards the Gorgon arena, where
you have to trigger its blue barrier, and make your way back inbound so that
Kratos is standing close to the arena's doors. If you're standing close enough
to the Arena's doors when the blue barrier spawns, you will be in-between the
doors and the barrier. This blue barrier has a certain elastic-quality when
Kratos jumps against it, and we will now use that to our advantage.

Once the barrier spawns, make Kratos face to the right-of-screen and launch from
the middle of the doors, this makes the barrier push you horizontally to the
left-and-up onto a ledge that belongs to the barrier. When you land on that
ledge, immediately Double-jump directly upwards to another ledge which also
belongs to the blue barrier. Then do a minor Double-jump towards yet-another
ledge on-top-of the arena's doors. From there, do a Double-glide long jump over
the arena to beyond its exit door, where there's a crucial loading-trigger you
must hit. (c: findlestick)

Sequence break (NG+): skip first Gorgon fight

There are even more alternatives to doing this skip on NG+. First method is to
drop off the rope and Jet Dash until you reach the corridor past the Gorgon
fight. (c: AKheon)

Another alternative is to do a Sorrow Jump on top of the chest after the rope
crossing and Jet Dash the rest of the way - this is probably easier than the
original method because of the better camera angle. (c: ???)

Yet another alternative is to do Icarus Ascension and sideways Blades Jet Dash
from the Hades Palace yard until you reach the post-fight corridor. First steer
around the rope platform, then start steering more and more to the right. This
variation is surprisingly easy to do - even if Kratos is in danger of going past
the corridor, the invisible walls will catch him, so you don't have to be
absolutely precise in doing this skip. The camera will also change in a helpful
way once you are close enough to your destination. (c: AKheon)

The newest alternative is to go to the inactive Olympia portal and grab a ledge
on top of it with a high jump. After climbing up, you can jump and sideways Jet
Dash to the next area. The route is quite direct and camera angle pretty amiable
to boot. (c: ???)

It's also possible to just JJ or CG Jumps to escape the Gorgon fight while it's
going on, but it's somewhat slower that way.

Whichever way you do the skip, there's a loading trigger close to the circular
room that you have to hit before you can make any progress beyond this area, so
keep that in mind.

Speed Strategy (NG): as the Gorgon battle starts, jump as soon as you regain
control of Kratos. This lets you avoid being grabbed by the Gorgon, saving a bit
of time. However, this trick is inconsistent, as the window to hit the X button
is very small. It works about 50% of the time.

You don't have to go get the Bow at all on NG+ since you already have it. You
can either shoot the bramble wall blocking your passage with the Bow or go
around it using Jet Dash, or even jump over it.

You can also do a variation of this skip on New Game. Using a series of Glides
from the broken bridge, with some out of bounds floor as your aid, you can make
your way past the bramble wall without Bow. But for some reason the next area is
not loaded at the moment. Maybe the game actually checks whether Kratos has the
Bow to load the next area? But even if you could do this, you still need Bow in
one of the final boss fights, so without it the game would become unwinnable.

Speed strategy: you can use the "slightly higher double jump" exploit to jump on
the chandelier above Peirithous without its cutscene activating. You have to
watch the cutscene later on anyway, but doing it later rather than sooner saves
a few seconds because this way you only need to lower the chandelier once. The
timing is pretty precise and the time saved is small, so don't fret if you don't
get it in a run. (c: AKheon)

A safe alternative on NG+ is to use a Severe Judgment jump to avoid the platform
and accomplish the same thing.

Wasted potential (NG+): the bramble prison can't be targeted or lit on fire with
the Bow. Also, you can't swim inside the brambles if you are swimming, but it's
surrounded with collision.


Other (NG+): if you swim inside the cages on the walls, Kratos becomes
imprisoned! There's collision on all sides, so you can't leave once you go in.


Collision flaw: the left side of the broken bridge has some uneven collision to
it. You can take the bramble pot and actually push it down into the river! I
also tried to enter the river riding Cerberus, but it seems Cerberus was too big
to enter.

Random: The Cerberus riding bit cannot end until you've lit Peirithous on fire.


Speed strategy: after getting the Bow, some enemies will spawn. You don't need
to fight them, and in a speedrun you shouldn't.


<The Depths of Hades>

Skip (NG+): skipping the Harpy cutscene

There are several different ways you can skip the fairly short Harpy cutscene
inside the big room.

(v1) = As soon as you enter the larger area with some Lost Souls and chests,
there is a collision flaw to your right. Rolling against the gray mound
sometimes lets Kratos through and he can go stand on the mound. From there you
can Jet Dash past the Harpy scenes. The collision breach is easiest to do with
either Claws or Whip roll. (c: AKheon)

(v2) = There's a collision flaw inside the corridor that leads to the Harpy
fight room. It's fairly high up on the right-hand wall right after you enter the
corridor. You can reach it by using a Sorrow Jump; in specialized circumstances
a CG high jump to the nearby Lost Soul also works (needs Chaos-mode to work).
(c: AKheon)

(v3) = do a Sorrow Jump from on top of the chest in the middle of the area and
Jet Dash towards the background. (c: findlestick)

Wasted potential (NG+): there's a wall breach before the climbing part, and
using it you can almost reach the Judges area early. However, this is probably
not useful because there is a loading trigger on the climbing wall that you miss
this way. (c: God Master Speedrunner)

Videos:

        not available
 
 
Speed strategy (NG+): You can skip parts of the climbing wall by utilizing Jet
Dash. However, be warned that if you fail to latch onto the wall and Jet Dash
too far out, the game may checkpoint you as you fall to your death and you have
to reload your last save to continue.

 
Sequence break (NG): It is also possible to skip parts of the climbing wall on
NG, with a precise jump towards the ledge with the chest.

Cutscene skip (NG+): you can skip the Judges overlook scene by Jet Dashing from
the climbing ceiling to the 2nd grapple point. The 1st grapple point isn't
active at this point, so you have to Jet Dash a bit blind to reach the 2nd one.
(c: AKheon)

Cutscene skip: On NG+, you can Jet Dash over the closed gate and gain early
access to the first portal from the cliff overlooking the Judges. Or on NG, you
can jump and Glide there using one of the Judges' hands as a platform.
Fortunately it's not too difficult. Just make sure not to aim too far to the
right because Kratos can't stand there. (c: satvara)

Doing this skips the cutscene where the Judges judge Kratos. The only thing this
cutscene does is to open the gate you just went around!

<The Three Judges>
 
Sequence break (NG+): Early chain break (PS3) (c: findlestick)

Early chain break is a technique that allows you to break the chain at the Three
Judges the first time you're in the area, resulting in a massive sequence break.
The trick works a bit differently on PS3 and PS4, so the two are listed
separately. This is the entry for the PS3-version.

This trick does not work in the most obvious way on the PS3. After breaking all
three neck stones and the exposed chain pieces, you should see the cinematic in
which the Judges get smashed. After that, gameplay continues like normal. So,
where's the sequence break? It is a few levels ahead, at the Chamber of the
Flame, where turning the crank throws you straight to the end game and you skip
a whole bunch of fetch quests and other distractions in the process!


The glitch happens with a near 100% certainty if you just follow these steps:

1. at the Three Judges overlook, latch onto the 2nd grapple point and skip the
first gate by Jet Dashing either directly to the upper level or just beyond the
gate.

2. Break the onyx stones of the first two Judges.

3. It's recommended to not go near the second portal at all, because doing this
may crash the game.

4. Go down to the Judge on the lower platform and break his stone.

5. High jump over the 3rd Judge's head, and Jet Dash down to the base of the
chain. This is an important factor in this skip, because using the portal to go
down to the base of the chain will result in a game crash.

6. Break the chain as soon as you can after getting to the base of the chain.
Avoid going close to the button in front of the chain at any point, because
otherwise you'll activate a wrong trigger and the skip won't work.

7. If you don't see the chain breaking cinematic a few seconds after breaking
the chains, something went wrong in the above steps. You most likely have to
reload and try again.

8. If the game crashes at any point, especially after the chain breaking
cinematic, don't fret. Just load the auto-save and you can continue like normal
afterwards.

9. Do Erebus Trials and continue on with the game like normal.


Other notes / troubleshooting:

- the most common trouble people seem to have with this skip is that the chain
breaking cutscene does not start after breaking the chains. This happens if you
get too close to the button in front of the chain at any point before having
broken the chain. You may end up too close to the button by accident if you do a
bad Jet Dash to the base of the chain in step 5. So be mindful of this.

- In case the cutscene does not start instantly after breaking the chains, it
will start later on when entering the next map. While an interesting occurrence,
this variation does not help in skipping to the end of the game. So you better
retry if this happens.

- another pretty interesting variation is doing failed early chain break, then
going into the next map before completing Erebus trials. You'll fall through
unloaded nothingness as normal, then get the chain breaking cutscene. Now, if
you Jet Dash in a precise way you end up back at the Three Judges... right
before the game crashes. It seems the game will reload the Three Judges map
after the FMV, which is a critical mistake and confuses the game into collapsing
in on itself.

- the button in front of the chain does not depress any longer after having
broken the stones of the Judges. Therefore you can't view the judging cutscene
after having killed the Judges.

- retrying from the last checkpoint after breaking the chain may cause the
Judges to lose their heads (?).
 
Videos:
1, findlestick's tutorial of the early chain break:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPmxKJ8lPKUv


Sequence break (NG+): early chain break (PS4)

This is a different and much more powerful variation of early chain break that
can only be done on PS4. Doing it literally sends Kratos from the Judges first
visit to the vent sequence leading to the end game, skipping even more of the
game in the process.

Try this:

Step 1 - from the Judges overlook, Jet Dash over the gate to get either upstairs
or to the 1st portal that you can use to go upstairs.

Step 2 - break the Judges' onyx stones, starting from the Judge on the left.

Step 3 - after breaking the third stone, you may use a Severe Judgment jump to
skip straight to downstairs, like in the PS3 version of the skip. However! Doing
this apparently necessitates a console restart after hitting the next
checkpoint, as the game will crash at the end of the vent ride.

Step 4 - to avoid a console restart and do the skip overall faster, climb back
up from the third broken onyx stone and instead use the other portal for going
back downstairs.

Step 5 - break the chain. After that, Kratos will be flying up as the game's
last vent section begins. The graphics are also screwed up momentarily.

        https://youtu.be/KI2Lg-7HhaE?t=1271
 
 
Wasted glitch potential (NG+): it's possible to enter the save menu right before
the chain breaking cutscene begins during early chain break. However, time keeps
running during this time, so it's not possible to save in-game time with this.
(c: findlestick)

Also, saving game during the cutscene just sends you back to the start of the
cutscene when you retry (in addition to making the game crash almost certainly
after the FMV ends).
 
There's some more info about this in the section of Three Judges re-visit.


Speed strategy? (NG+): when doing Augean Stampede to one of the chains,
sometimes the other chain gets damaged for no reason as well. When you get to
it, it's already 'yellow' and only needs a few hits to break after that. This
has to be done as quickly as possible after retrying from the checkpoint.


Sequence break (NG): after completing the Trials, you can skip the rest of this
area with a Sky Jump. Walk right and back from the button and grab the low ledge
that goes diagonally through the area. Once Kratos is hanging onto it, moving
him towards the stairs causes a type of sky jump and sends Kratos very high into
the air. From there you can Glide down and reach the other side of the area
fast. This skips some navigation and a cutscene of talking with Pandora.
(c: findlestick)

Random: you can attack the Three Judges, but it's useless. The chest plate of
the leftmost judge actually repels Kratos if he tries to grapple it.
 

Sequence break (NG+): skipping Erebus Trials

It's possible but unfortunately fairly slow to skip the Trials on NG+.

When entering the next area before having completed the trials, Kratos just
falls down in the middle of some blackness. The next map exists, but it's far to
the back and left, and you can't reach it with just Jet Dash alone. So you have
to Jet Dash under the next map, then use the death floor infinite jump to lift
Kratos up to the level of the next map again. (c: findlestick)

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMrqRYR3F4U#t=57


Wasted potential (NG): skipping Erebus Trials

It’s possible to enter the caves in the next area with the Levitation Glitch
active. Unfortunately, once you enter the caves, the game cancels Kratos’
Levitation glitch when he hits the trigger that takes you near the next area.
(c: findlestick)


Sequence break (swimming) (NG+): you can also skip Erebus Trials if you have
swimming glitch active. As usual, moving on to the next map before having
completed the trials results in Kratos appearing in the middle of strange
blackness. But the next map IS loaded, you just have to find it by swimming to
the back-left. (c: AKheon)
 
 
Speed tactic: just spamming magic won't work in Trial 1. The game expects a
certain amount of people to be converted into wandering souls - until then, the
enemies just keep spawning endlessly. So wait some time before doing anything.
 
 
Random (NG+): leaving the trials early by using Jest Jump is possible. The
graphics in the upper areas disappear, much like if you escape the Hellbreeder
fight later on in the game.
 
 
Cutscene skip (NG+): after fighting through the Erebus trials, do a high
jump/Jet Dash from near the Erebus Trial pedestal straight to the passage that
leads you to the next place. It skips the Pandora cutscene and some navigation.
The easiest way to do this is to do Severe Judgment jump from on top of the
Erebus Trials pedestal towards lower-right of the screen and then Jet Dash
(until camera changes).


Sequence break (NG): you can skip the small platform just before the Pandora
cutscene by double jumping and gliding directly to the platform that the Pandora
statue is on, to the left. Saving a few seconds.

Other: from the end of the rope climb, you can glide over to the first Judge and
land on an invisible floor in front of the statue's chest. At this date there is
no use to this glitch. This chest is also the area where you can start a rare
Air-walking glitch, if you can get there with Levitation glitch active. (c:

Other: Teleportation Trigger and Path to the Forge's actual location.

Trigger location: upon entering the cave.

Actual location of Path to the Forge: air-swim extremely far towards where
Peirithous was loaded earlier (very approx). Unfortunately, it’s so ridiculously
far away that trying to Jet Dash there from the Three Judges, would be
impossible. Even if you tried air-swimming there, it would be slower than just
swimming into the cave’s teleportation trigger.


<Path to The Forge>

Wasted potential (NG+): the walls here seem too high to cross with even Sorrow
Jump.


Cutscene skip (NG+): do a Jest Jump or CG high jump to a nearby Fiend, and Jet
Dash to the vent puzzle room outside bounds. You skip the cutscene at the
entrance (in addition to cutting a few corners getting there).
 
 
Speed strategies: quicker vent puzzle completion
 
First of all, on NG+ you never have to light the vent on fire for the first time
to reach the second floor. You can just Jet Dash against the right wall to
ascend with Jet Ascension and reach the higher level in no time.

On NG+ you can Jest Jump using one of the Fiends for a quick foray onto the
highest floor (use the back corner for Jet Ascension effect).
 
At the top floor, grab the pot and shove it between the railing and the elevator
machinery, then try to turn it counter-clockwise. The pot will rise up on the
railing, and from there you can just kick it to the vent. This skips having to
use the elevator. Note that the small mise scuttling around can actually break
Kratos' hold of the pot. You probably need luck to prevent this from happening.
(c: AKheon)

Videos:

Sequence break: skip Vent puzzle

There's a very difficult tactic for entirely skipping the vent puzzle that
requires Sky Jump and can be done on both NG or NG+.

After riding the elevator to the top floor, you can double Glide Jump from the
right side of the elevator to reach a glitchy ledge on the left. The specific
spot is hard to name, but it's under and further to the back from the "rock"
jutting out of the wall. When Kratos hits the glitchy ledge while Gliding, he is
shot quickly to the air. Being close enough to the metal grid will lower it just
enough for Kratos to fly past it, skipping the puzzle. (c: findlestick)

Another way to skip this puzzle on NG+ is to do a Sorrow Jump from on-top-of the
railing next to the upper-chests. You just have to make sure that the Undending
Sorrow-portion of your jump pushes you up-and-through the platform that lowers.
Once you’re up through the middle of the platform, you can simply continue
jumping through the platform and grab the ledge at the exit above. (c:
findlestick)

Videos:
1, findlestick's video of the NG skip:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxJrc37tc2E


Random: touching the edge of the grid while rising up using Wings can cause
Kratos to switch to climbing stance although he is flying up in the air. This
air "climbingness" doesn't last long, only until you fall back onto solid
ground.


Collision flaw: by Gliding against the 2nd floor vent puzzle floor from the
front-right, Kratos can sink inside the wall and start walking underneath. You
can make your way into the room with a lot of Hades' Arms early this way, but it
serves no purpose since you get stuck.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV3A_nT_7Zo


Other: you can use Magneto Jump at the upper-area to breach the floor at the
chests, where the Fiends spawn. There’s a large solid floor underneath from
where you can make an out-of-bounds route to where the gap where the first pot
is. However, the floor underneath where all the other pots are lined-up don’t
have solid collision. Otherwise you might’ve been able to walk up to the area
beyond the climbable platform. (c: findlestick)

Other: Rarely, when opening the chest in the room that has many hands, one of
the hands will grab Kratos right as he opens the chest. The chest will open but
will not give the feather.

Other: in the area overlooking a strange golden dome, there's an unique Lost
Soul who does not attempt to attack you (unless you provoke it). Also, the souls
from Claws CG do not try to target him at all.


Other: in this area there are pots directly next to Chests, so it should be
possible to breach the floor at these areas with Magneto Jump’s ledge-magnetism.



Wasted potential (NG+): it's possible to JJ outside bounds by using one of the
sentries that spawn after you defeat the two Stone Taloses. You can take a
stroll on top of the golden dome! From there it's possible to reach the area
that's past The Forge's closed exit gate, but nothing beyond is loaded (it is
speculated that the loading trigger is in the middle of the path in The Forge).
(c: AKheon)
 
 
Cutscene skip (NG+): from the golden dome, you can also Jet Dash straight to the
save point of The Forge. Hephaestus never loads if you do this, and so the
cutscene of the place, if triggered, will contain Kratos speaking with a voice
in his head with no one else around (or so it looks like). But this is not the
reason you flew all the way to this place - instead, it was to skip the cutscene
by going to the Aphrodite portal using the wall with Boots of Hermes and then
Jet Dashing over the cutscene trigger to freedom! (c: AKheon)

This is only one alternative to skipping The Forge cutscenes on NG+. There are
some others listed below...

Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9TlfmxL17I
 
 
<The Forge>

Other (NG+ only): if you jump off the ledge into The Forge but suddenly turn and
Jet Dash back to the ledge, you'll find that the previous map has unloaded.

Videos:
1, atrexthiswork's video:
        https://youtu.be/ny-9w5_AVus?t=72

 
Speed strategy (NG+): you can Jet Dash over the short intro cutscene to The
Forge. Camera angles turn quite bad as a result, but they get better once you
retry from a checkpoint. As another speed bonus, you don't have to pull the
switch that opens the gate out of The Forge afterwards - the gate appears to
have disappeared while you weren't looking (at least if you retry from
checkpoint).


Cutscene skip (NG+): the entire Hephaestus cutscene can also be skipped by
moving pretty high up on the staircase and then Jet Dashing towards the gate.
There is a collision flaw to the left side of the gate that Kratos can breach
through at the correct height, so you never have to go close to Hephaestus or
use the switch there.

Videos:

Wasted skip potential (NG+): at this point, the portal to Aphrodite's Chamber is
inactive, and the Pit of Tartarus is unloaded as well. It's also possible to get
to the underwater areas where you will end up after defeating Hades, but you
can't go into the Throne area itself because it's unloaded (and as far as I can
tell, it can't be made to load from here)
 
 
Random (NG+): if you swim past the gate to Pit of Tartarus, Kratos may freeze
momentarily in an alarmed standing pose, as if you hit a cutscene trigger. But
nothing in particular seems to happen. Another oddity you can find by swimming:
to the right of The Forge, there's a small black collisionless cube floating by
itself.


Sequence break (NG+): you can skip Rage of Sparta (along with the cutscene
before it, and the tutorial fight) by doing a high jump towards the background
wall at a correct spot before the trigger. Jet Dashing, you can reach the
entrance to the Palace this way quite easily, or even directly into the Hades’
Puzzle-lobby. (c: AKheon)

<Palace of Hades>

Sequence break: skip Cerberi fight

You can skip the fight with Cerberi at the Palace's gate by Jet Dashing around
the gate on New Game+. (c: satvara)

However, this skip can be done on NG too with some extra platforming. Go near
the gate, then jump on top of the right foot where there's some floor for Kratos
to stand on. Then do a small high jump to reach the platform where the right
Cerberus is laying: double jump, air triangle attack after second jump and a
quick flick of RoS to give Kratos extra height and length.

After getting on the platform, double jump and Glide to the left platform. From
there do a high but short double jump to get on top of the left foot. And on the
left side there is less invisible wall on the way so you can do a short Glide to
land on some floor of the entrance hall. Then just move forward to hit the next
fight and you're set. (c: AKheon)

A third way to skip the fight which is also NG compatible is to use a Sky Jump.
There is a glitchy ledge to the left side of the fight arena, near the small
holes on the ground. Grabbing it will send Kratos flying high into air, where
you can hover over the bramble wall and doorway.
(c: findlestick)

Skipping the lobby fight as well while out of bounds seems difficult, but it
hasn't been completely disproven yet. §

Sequence break (NG+): you can Sorrow Jump to the left of the door to grab on a

Sequence break: skip the 1st floor of Hades Palace (c: findlestick / AKheon)

Doing a small high jump from on top of the stone stack at the back of the room,
you can grab a ledge ABOVE the wooden frame behind it. This takes you directly
to the above room where the Minotaurs and Dogs normally appear. This is a very
useful and easy skip of the very first part of this puzzle, and can be used on
NG too if you use the "slightly higher double jump" exploit.

2, AKheon's video of this skip in NG conditions:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuYLYVQXwAg


Sequence break: reach the lower floor elevator early

This is a larger skip that obsoletes the aforementioned 1st floor skip as well
as some 2nd floor time save tactics listed below as well.

First climb the tree. From the top of the tree's climbing wall, do a quick
double jump and then Glide back towards the tree at a certain angle to grab an
invisible ledge a little above Persephone's coffin. On top of the coffin the
camera angle is not particularly good, but you can fix it by doing a stationary
RoS high jump for example.

After that, you can Glide to the back of the room, going around the Hades
statue, to grab another invisible ledge. This makes the following part of the
skip easier, but it is not mandatory to do.

Your next goal is to land on some floor close to where the wheel on the first
floor is. So find a pillar-like structure from far left and attempt to land a
little to the right of it, Krataos should land on something that sounds
metallic. Then, do a droopy double jump to the back and left to drop down under
a wall that is in Kratos' way and Glide inside the elevator room. Be careful not
to slip in bounds here by accident.

Now you can play this dungeon onward having reached the elevator early. This way
Kratos can go up to the upper left switch room before even activating the entire
puzzle. Read more about the possible side effects of doing this from below. (c:

Other: if you do things in the wrong order and put the stone block under the 2nd
floor elevator before making the elevator descend, upon returning upstairs the
stone block and the elevator are back up but neither can be ever activated or
moved again. So at worst you can screw yourself over with this. (c: findlestick)

there before even having lifted up the coffin and "activated" the puzzle, you
basically do a part of the puzzle without the accompanying bothersome short
cutscenes, which saves time. You also skip having to turn the crank one extra
time doing this, which also saves you the trouble of dealing with the spawning
enemies as well.

On NG+ you can do a SJ high jump and Jet Dash under the ladder holes. If you aim
away from the ladder, Kratos can grab an invisible ledge and pull himself up.
This is harder to do on the left side for some reason. (c: findlestick)

But there is a way to do this on NG as well. First of all, do not turn the crank
in the middle after arriving to the 2nd floor of the Palace. Instead, head to
the left path and climb the ladder. You need to do a droopy double jump and
Glide to land on top of Hades' right arm. While on the arm, you can walk on it
to reach the left upper area early and save time.

Note that the wheel that pulls in Hades' arm glitches up if you activate it too
early. So if you're careless, you can get yourself stuck here... don't do things
in the wrong order. (c: AKheon)

Other: another related glitch after having gone to the upper areas early is that
Kratos teleports in a strange way after rotating the left wheel and putting the
stone block under it. You hear the sound of the block being in place, then after
a few seconds Kratos teleports back to the stone block mysteriously.

If you try to open the nearby chest at that time, Kratos breaks out of it as he
teleports. While the chest becomes opened, all of its contents disappear and
this is basically a good way to waste a chest. (c: findlestick)

Sequence break (NG+): skipping entire Hades Palace puzzle v1 (c: satvara)

There are at least three ways to skip the entire puzzle inside the Palace of
Hades. The first method was found by satvara.

Climb up the big tree and get to the higher area with chests. From there you
have to do a jump to reach a secret ledge that is to the back of the area,
hidden inside graphics below Hades' statue. It's easy to reach with Severe
Judgment jump + Jet Dash, but don't start the jump too near the chests, or else
you get blocked by additional collision.

Now, when on the secret ledge, the tricky part begins. You have to do another
high jump (Severe Judgment is again enough) towards the foreground. You need to
Jet Ascension against the collision of the Hades statue lower half and Jet
Ascend on top of a small floor. If the graphics get all messed up, it's a good
sign and means that you've accessed the boss fight map. Then just start Jet
Dashing deeper into the area until the boss intro starts.

Sequence break (NG+): skipping entire Hades Palace puzzle v2 (c: findlestick)

Later findlestick devised an arguably easier method for doing this skip: after
climbing the tree to the top, jump off and do a small high jump followed by Jet
Dash inside the tree to grab the side of the coffin that is lying there. You can
also do a very quick double jump followed by Gliding to do this, if that is
easier for you.

Once on top of the coffin, you can High Jump and then Jet Dash directly around
the Hades statue and end up inside of it. Once inside the statue, you hit a
trigger that loads the start of the Hades battle and then Jet Dash to the
background and end up at the Hades battle.This can be slightly tricky to do
since the statue has a lot of collision.

Sequence break (NG+): skipping entire Hades Palace puzzle v3 (c: AKheon)

An extra method for doing the skip. If you go to the left path past the Hades
statue, you find some urns at the end of the corridor. Jump behind the rightmost
urn, then run against the wall and slowly turn Kratos a little to the left. With
a correct angle, a double jump will make Kratos breach the wall here, and from
there you can Jet Dash around the corner and backwards to hit the trigger that
loads the boss room. Quick reflexes are needed.

<Hades>

Other: being out of bounds as Hades fight starts

You end up out of bounds as the Hades fight starts using one of the NG+ Hades
puzzle skips listed above. You can for example Jet Dash directly to the top of
the roof of Hades' battle arena. From there you can see Hades in the background
(near his throne) while he says his long speech to Kratos.
 
If you are still on the roof as the fight begins, hitting some sections of the
roof registers "hits" but you can never get Hades to his next phases via this.
If you then jump back down to the arena, the whole area is much darker than
normal and "sweet spots" become active at some of the edges of the arena.
 
It's possible for you to end up swimming under the arena as well. But this is
not a bad thing: if you're swimming as the Hades fight begins proper, you
automatically skip the soul drain Hades attempts to perform on Kratos, saving
maybe 5-6 seconds. You can also swim a bit outside the arena itself, but it
seems there's collision preventing you from leaving the fight completely just
yet. Another test has revealed that the next area is not loaded at this point
yet.

If you are floating in the water (out-of-bounds) or if you are standing under
the arena at the end of Hades' long speech, Kratos will get stuck in an odd pose
for a while. If he is under the arena he will walk around in an odd/unnatural
pose. Activating RoS will make him glow blue but without Kratos going into his
normal RoS animations.

Kratos and throws him. The entire animation will take place high in mid air.
(Looks comical).

Speed strategy: break out of tug-of-war

If you jump during the first frames when retrying from the last checkpoint
during the "tug-of-war" phase of the battle, Kratos breaks out and can move
freely during this phase. This is a big time save since you can use the Bow to
damage Hades instead of having to fight him normally. You can do this quite
easily by buffering a jump over a checkpoint retry by pressing X as you enter
the menu to retry. (c: satvara)

This breakout can also be done by keeping block held while rapidly changing
weapons (NG+).

Wasted Glitch Potential (NG+): additional glitches during tug-of-war fight

If you break out of the tug-of-war fight, you can enter the water by spamming
Nemean roar at the right time, or by spamming Nemesis Rage to the left and right
of the arena. This is not easy to do at first, but it stops Kratos from being
forced to enter the animation where he is dragging himself out of the water.
Once in the water, the trigger that forces Kratos into the animation where he is
dragging himself out of the water becomes defunct, and you can now move around
freely and do some unusual things! You can even leave the arena at this stage,
but the next area is not yet loaded.
 
Some of the strange glitches you can then do in this area include, doing a
chaotic nonsensical tug-of-war with Hades while they are both on the same side
of the water. You can activate the mini-game where Kratos throws his blade at
Hades' head while they are both on the same side of the water, causing Kratos to
teleport oddly back to the other side of the arena and the mini-game where
Kratos slams Hades against the roof becoming displaced. Kratos can also engage
in the tug-of-war while standing underneath the arena, which causes Kratos to
look like he is fighting one of his own blades. The blade will thrash around
violently in air with a life of its own, as if it were possessed.
 
Hades can also sometimes go into his earlier phases during this tug-of-war
phase, including where he does Soul Summon and where he makes his Claw come out
from the floor or his claw will even come out from under the water if Kratos is
in the water at the time. (c: findlestick, others?)

Wasted potential: during the Claws tutorial, the walls around you are too high
for you to escape by any known means.


Speed strategy (NG+ only?): fast Hades kill

On Any% NG+ conditions (Easy difficulty, all weapons maxed, with Fear Kratos),
the last stage of the Hades fight can sometimes end in just two rounds.
Basically, you have to hit Hades with only the second triangle-attack, so you
have to time the first triangle-attack so that it doesn't hit Hades. If done
correctly, this saves about 5-10 seconds. (c: clockworkexe)

Other: starting swimming glitch (and getting regen magic)

There are multiple ways to go out of bounds while swimming in this area, and as
is the tradition, this allows Kratos to go and swim in air to his heart's
content. As a very noteworthy bonus, having swimming glitch also makes it
possible to get Regen Magic soon afterwards.
 
First method was found by satvara. You have to swim until you come out of the
submerged tunnel before the Claws tutorial fight. You have to go as left as
possible and do a jump towards the foreground. Now, the game zips Kratos back
inside the submerged tunnel and everything looks to be fine... but is it?

After waiting a few seconds, Kratos will get sucked into the ceiling. At first
he can't swim dash or move very fast for reasons unknown, but if you lower
Kratos' altitude just a little bit you get back freedom of movement while still
remaining inside the ceiling. Then, doing a swim dash to the right at a certain
point - roughly around the spot where there's the grating in the ceiling -
Kratos goes through the wall and you can continue swimming in the air. (c:
satvara)

Videos:
1, Satvara's vid
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_oLAxUqotc


Later, findlestick found another method. Swim along the water's surface from the
save point towards Hades' body until a wall of collision naturally stops you.
Stay on the right side of the tunnel. Get Kratos just slightly submerged. Hold
left analog to the right and also hold triangle down. There's a small flaw in
the collision around here that Kratos pops through with some luck - you'll
notice it once Kratos rises back to the water surface deeper than normal. From
there you jump and Glide a little to the side to touch the water surface while
entirely out of bounds... and go from there. This is a bit trickier method than
the above, but in some circumstances the camera angles are more manageable. (c:
findlestick)
 
Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ2__QG86YE#t=340

 
Since you get swimming glitch before the Soul Summon tutorial fight by either of
these methods, you can proceed to activate the fight - the fight grants you
regen magic - and then escape it by swimming. This lets you keep regen magic.

However, this comes with a price: you cannot switch weapons once the tutorial
fight begins. The game locks Kratos' weapon to Claws of Hades... but fortunately
you can get around this by selecting Blades immediately after closing the Soul
Summon prompt that appears just as you enter the tutorial area.
 
If you skip all the other regen magic tutorials in this game as well, you get to
keep regen magic all the way to the end of the game.


Getting to The Forge at the end of this all is slightly problematic since you
need to swim there without the camera following Kratos. Just a general hint, aim
to the left and up.

And before leaving, you first have to hit a certain trigger that is just beyond
the Claws’ tutorial fight. You know when that map is loaded when you hear the
sounds of smithing in the distance.


Swimming glitch (NG+): you can also start swimming glitch after the regen magic
tutorial. Do a Severe Judgment jump and Jet Dash to breach the wall to the left
in the small tunnel up ahead. From there you can drop out of bounds and hit
water at the same time, starting swimming glitch. (c: AKheon)

<Backtrack to Olympia portal>

Cutscene skip (swimming): you can easily skip the Hephaestus cutscene by just
swimming around it.


Swimming glitch (NG+): if you didn't get swimming glitch just after Hades'
Throne Room, you can also get it here at the Forge. It is done by Alt-Jet
Dashing from in front of Hephaestus, using the out of bounds-spot to the left
and steering quickly towards the foreground (stay as close as possible to the
outside of the rocky wall). It's then possible to end up underneath the pool
that is near Hephaestus, and from there you just need to touch the water that is
in front of the lever. On NG+ the easiest way to do this is by doing a Death
collision jump that will hit the water surface eventually. Since nothing is
loaded beyond the tunnel you then just simply swim out through the tunnel on the
left of screen with your swimming glitch! This can be repeated later on in the
game when you return to this same location. (c: findlestick)

After getting Boots of Hermes you can do this trick on NG too. To hit the water
surface in front of the lever, you can just barely hit it by Jet Ascension from
sideways Alt Jet Dash.

Speed strategy (swimming): you have to turn the rotating room for some way
before the Realm of Hades loads again, but you don't have to turn it all the
way. Turn it to the first stop and then just swim your way out.

Note that on Chaos-mode you won't survive turning the crank while swimming
because of the enemies, so you must end swimming at the checkpoint leading to
the rotating room. Dash into the rotating room at ground level and retry;
afterwards Kratos should be back on his feet and the swimming glitch is over.


Sequence break (NG+): skip navigation and Olympia intro cutscene

Turn the rotating room until its first stop. Then, from the right hand side of
the rotating room you can do a Sorrow Jump up onto a ledge and from there you
directly go to Realm of Hades. This also lets you skip a trigger close to the
rotating room that loads the Olympia intro cutscene, saving further time. (c:
findlestick)

Cutscene skip (swimming): you can easily skip the cutscene that shows you the
Hades-Olympia portal as your next destination.


Other (swimming): at this point, if you're swimming, I suggest you end air
swimming at the climbing wall nearby. Otherwise you'll get stuck outside the
City of Olympia.


Skip (NG+): you can skip the short scene before entering Hades-Olympia portal by
SJ jumping over it. If you had skipped the portal showing cutscene earlier, this
procedure becomes more difficult for some reason - but not impossible. In this
case I suggest you Jet Dash over from the save point platform towards the
backside of the portal. (c: AKheon).


<City of Olympia>

Other (NG+): displaced Olympia intro

If you sideways Jet Dash into the Olympia portal, Kratos will end up slightly
displaced during the animation, causing him to fall under the map as gameplay
resumes afterwards. This lets you (on NG+ at least) just run past all the Gaia
events and activate the triggers in any order you wish.
(c: findlestick)

Videos:

        https://youtu.be/SqXJ3tGMsYI?t=401


Other: the portal back to Hades does not work. In fact, there's absolutely no
collision around it.


Cutscene skip (NG+): if you had earlier skipped the trigger in front of the
rotating room that loads the Olympia intro cutscene, the intro cannot begin upon
entering Olympia. As a result, Kratos - after falling in unloaded darkness for a
few seconds - will be free to move the instant he arrives. Note that because
Kratos is "off-camera" the controls will be - for the most part - in reverse.

Videos:

Random (swimming): after arriving to Olympia, you lose control of Kratos. The
only way to get around that is to skip the intro using the skip above. Even
after that, swimming at Olympia is very difficult because of the horrible camera
and the fact that when Gaia climbs up the ridge and the screen starts shaking,
you again lose control of Kratos. Pretty annoying.

Swimming exploration reveals some strange test object floating in nothingness
past the Olympia gate. It looks like two cubes with lightning shooting between
them...? There's also a collision-less piece of a bridge floating nearby.

In some circumstances, there's a Gaia standing in t-pose above the Olympia level
and she can be reached while swimming. You probably have to skip the trigger of
her appearance for this to work. (c: AKheon)

Wasted glitch potential (NG & NG+): can't skip Gaia's arm

You can Severe Judgment jump to grab a ledge on top of Gaia's hand to get over
it early. However, until the whole ordeal with Gaia is dealt with, including
throwing her severed hand off the ledge, the next area will not load.
 
You can't break Gaia's arm without having first seen the cutscene of Gaia asking
your help, so you also can't skip that.
 
If you skip Gaia's arm, then go and activate the Olympia door and then retry,
upon retry Gaia's hand will be both invisible and invincible. If you had already
severed it, it will be invisible until you touch it. You can backtrack to the
area where you came from to have Gaia climb up the cliff again... but the arm
remains indestructible because the game thinks you never saw the intro cutscene
with her.
 
Interestingly, when examining the door with Gaia still there breathing down your
neck, I sometimes "won" the Door to Olympia fight with the dogs still spawning.
Too bad this knowledge probably can't be put to use... well, except maybe in a
pacifist run? (c: AKheon)

Sequence break: skip the battle at Door to Olympia

There are multiple different ways you can skip the fight here, some are for NG+
but at least one works for NG as well.

On NG+, one of the easiest ways to do this skip is to start the fight, then use
Jest Jump on one of the enemies, then simply Jet Dash into the cave.
Alternatively, you can grab the ledge on top of the massive doors by using
Magneto Jump. (c: findlestick)

To save additional time, you can avoid having to start the fight at all. Do a
Sorrow Jump and grab an invisible ledge on top of the "shield" held by the
left-side statue. From there, you can double jump and grab another ledge on top
of the massive doors. If you now Jet Dash around the doors, you can go as far as
the Centaur fight arena from here, although doing this is inadvisable since you
skip an important loading trigger that is at the corner near the last save
point. Dealing with the camera may also be somewhat difficult. (c: findlestick)

If you want to save even more time, Jet Dash in a precise way into the corridor
with the save point from the wrong direction, hit the loading trigger and then
quickly get back out. This way you can skip the Perses cutscene too since it
still hasn't had time to load and appear on the map. (c: JolieLegal)

A verified NG compatible way of skipping the fight involves double launching an
enemy and then doing Blades CG to get height and Claws CG exploit to use double
jump in air. (c: findlestick)

Other (NG+?): By doing things in a strange order you can get the first Harpy to
do all its "cutscene motions", but with Kratos free to move around. If you then
grab the harpy during its "cutscene flying motions" Kratos will passively grab
it with both hands while flying and will not stab it. Eventually the Harpy will
vanish into thin air, and Kratos will fall. (c: findlestick)

you can see the "cinematic" Harpy just hanging around. If you ride another Harpy
up ahead back to the cinematic Harpy, then latch onto it, it becomes duplicated.
You can then keep riding the same Harpy over and over again and get infinite red
orbs by repeatedly brutal killing it. (c: findlestick)

Speed strategy (NG+): You can Jet Dash through all the sections that normally
demand you use a Harpy to get across.
 
 
Sequence Break (NG+): skipping Perses cutscene v1 and random bits

You can skip the Perses cutscene a few different ways from inside the Harpy
corridor. One method is doing a high jump into a Jet Dash from on top of one of
those golden chests and then onto an invisible roof above the Harpy crossing.
There is a wall of collision that you need to Glide around while on the roof to
be able to access the Centaur battle arena.
 
You can leap directly to the Chimera battle from the Harpy crossing rooftop, but
nothing interesting happens. You get missing scenery, and annoying skewed camera
angles as well as become stuck - until restart. (c: findlestick)

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kApRgKbOV8


Sequence break (NG+): skipping Perses cutscene v2

Another, more direct way to skip Perses cutscene is to just Jet Dash around it.
A reliable setup for doing this is to examine the green chest near the save
point to align Kratos, then double jump and - without touching the left analog
stick at all during this time - Alt. Jet Dash forward for a decent length, then
to the left. Camera angle should change and show the next area, and from there
you can easily navigate your way on solid ground.

One thing to beware, though: if you hit the Perses cutscene trigger while out of
bounds, your game will crash. So do your best to prevent that from happening! If
you use this setup, you can easily avoid this fate, though. (c: AKheon)

Sequence break (NG): skipping Olympia on New Game (c: findlestick)

It's possible to skip the whole Olympia section on New Game using a complex
series of tricks. It begins by first skipping the Perses cutscene: use a Harpy
to get near the roof level at the end of the 2nd crossing, then jump and grab a
difficult-to-hit invisible ledge. Kratos gains a bit more height from the Harpy
if you first launch it in air, then do a normal grab to it - the extra height
makes this part of the skip easier to do. After climbing up, you are on the
Harpy crossing roof and can go around and jump to the Centaur fight arena as
usual.

As a side effect of skipping the Perses cutscene, there is now a glitched Harpy
at the corner close to the Chimera fight room that you can use to get to the
next area early, but the procedure is difficult. You need to approach the Harpy
out of bounds by slowly moving towards it on the ledge to the right. When close
to the Harpy, you must hit it with a melee attack to push it away from the
corner or else Kratos and the Harpy get caught by some collision. Then, when
grabbing the Harpy you should aim your grab and fly to the left a little to
prevent the Harpy from unloading - it tends to do that if you fly to the right
too early.

Finally, when riding the Harpy you should only press forward on the left analog
once every 1,5 seconds or so to get the Harpy to move a longer distance before
dying. Done precisely, Kratos should be able to jump and reach the balcony, thus
skipping almost everything in Olympia.

An alternative that is mostly viable on NG+ is to have Lv. 4 Claws and do
Unending Sorrow to let Kratos use his second jump and Glide at the end of the
Harpy ride.

This skip was originally discovered in the GoW III Demo, where it was easier to
do since Kratos could do a Glide after riding on a Harpy.

Sequence break (NG+): You can cross the big chasm with Jet Dash quite easily,
skipping any events related to Chimera, the crossbow and Harpies. For another
small skip, stay outside bounds after reaching the other side, for example by
landing on top of one of the pedestals which line the outside of the wall. From
there, Jet Dash to the bridge on the right of screen, and bingo!

Depending on how direct your route is, rarely the ledge civilian may not spawn.
If that happens, just retry from the last checkpoint and he should appear.

Wasted Glitch Potential (NG+): After a high jump (or: from Harpy crossing
rooftop) you can Jet Dash across the big chasm and get directly to the ledge
where the civilian is or onto the lowermost ledge of the climbing bit which
takes you to the Helios arena. Novel as this is, it's useless because it skips a
loading trigger. When you proceed to the battle arena, Helios is totally absent
from the complete cutscene, as are the soldiers that fall from the sky. The
Cyclops never appears and the battle never takes place. You then get stuck
because the next area is not yet loaded.

If you now jump back outside bounds and activate the trigger which loads Helios'
appearance (it is on the walkway that has the ladder at the end of it), you do
actually get Helios to appear. Unfortunately he is just a prostate character
model with whom you can't interact in any way.

Battle exploit: You can drop the Centaur into the Harpy Crossing-pit. This is
done by getting on top of the block that the harpy was standing on in the Perses
cutscene, then shooting Bow shots to provoke him to do his charge attack. If you
then successfully win the mini-game, the Centaur will plummet and die in the
chasm. (c: findlestick)

Battle exploit (NG, Very Hard), quick Centaur-kill:

For some reason, when you hit arrows at the Centaur after countering its grab
twice, the circle prompt appears early. In this video below, the Centaur starts
with full health. Note that if you hit the arrows outside of this window after
the counter-attack, you will need way more arrows. This glitch can also be done
with other attacks, potentially even with just one grab, but this strategy with
arrows is the most consistent. Especially useful in Very Hard difficulty. (c:

where the floor graphics don't load. It looks like Chimera and Kratos are
battling while floating in mid air.

Battle exploit (NG+): You can leave the Chimera Battle by high jumping up on a
walkable collision that is above the Ballista. From there you can high jump into
a Jet Dash and go over the Collision that is at the entrance to the battle
arena. But this is pointless since you can skip this whole fight anyway. (c:

Speed strategy / Other: After the Harpy crossing - to the right side of the
screen - there are some 'secret' ledges that Kratos can climb that lead directly
to the bridge on the right of screen. It's almost as if this had been an
alternate route to get through this area that was abandoned by developers.

Regardless, you CAN use it as an alternate route, in a NG run for example. Just
steer a Harpy to the right so that you can jump on some floor out of bounds, and
from there use the ledges to go to the path leading to Helios. (c: findlestick)

Speedrun strategy (NG+): Olympia ledge speed route, version 1

Get on the ladder and do a moderate ladder jump to rise in air. After that,
carefully Glide on the ledge... but keep Bow active when landing to keep Kratos
in his normal state instead of beginning shimmying.

If the civilian spawned, you can launch him in the air and do a small high jump
(for example with Claws CG) and grab a ledge on top of the civilian. And from
there it's just a matter of jumping directly up onto the arena.

You may be wondering... why not just use ladder jump to reach the arena without
going by the shimmy at all? You get stuck if you do this because there is still
a loading trigger on the shimmying path you need to hit to load Helios. (c:

Speedrun strategy (NG+): Olympia ledge speed route (v2)

Firstly, you need to Jet Dash from the Centaur arena directly to the ladder that
leads to the window-civilian. Depending on where you land on the ground, you can
get checkpointed there, and the skip does not work. So make sure that you don’t
land on the ground while Jet Dashing to the ladder.

When on the ladder, if you climb to the top and go just a bit forward, you will
also get checkpointed, and the skip fails too. The idea of this skip is to set a
custom checkpoint near the start of the shimmy-wall by landing on it without
shimmying from the top of the ladder, so that you can later break Kratos out of
shimmying along the wall.

The most reliable way to get to the start of the shimmy-wall, is to climb the
ladder and Jet Dashing to the shimmy-wall past the right-side of the ladder (an
alternative is to use the Ladder Infinite Jump). When you land on the
shimmy-wall, a checkpoint will be set. Restart checkpoint, and while keeping X
pressed the whole time, move Kratos away from the wall. When Kratos falls, the X
will make him use the wings, and from there you can double jump and Jet Dash to
the last climbing wall-section. (c: Jolielegal)

Speed strategy: after killing the civilian who blocks your path on the ledge,
drop down with R1 as soon as possible. This is because Kratos moves faster when
hanging from a ledge.
 
 
Other (NG+): If you do things in completely wrong order, the civilian might
reappear after you've already killed him once. The civilian stands in the usual
'idle' pose for character models that have no animation going on. He does not
block Kratos' path, and if Kratos tries to grab him, Kratos gets teleported back
a few hundred meters, to the gate which he has to open after crossing the chasm.
Incidentally, that was the same spot my last checkpoint had brought me...


<Helios>
 
Wasted potential (NG+): You can't destroy the onyx shielders guarding Helios
with your Cestus. You can - however -  do a simple roll against their shields,
and Kratos will penetrate them and end up inside the soldiers' guard formation.
While in there, you cannot interact with Helios or the soldiers or harm them in
any way.
 
Also, the secret door on the side of the cliff can't be unveiled before Helios
has lost his head. In fact, you don't even want to mess up with the secret door
before finishing Helios because the door can glitch up and become inoperable
afterwards.
 
It's possible to get past the door by doing high jump to the upper ledges and
jumping from there, but the areas beyond aren't even loaded at this point! D'oh.

Other (NG+?): If Kratos is not inside the actual arena when the Cyclops drops
from the sky, Kratos will do his animation where he drops to his knees, but the
Cyclops will never actually appear. And you can't progress if you hadn't already
used a Cyclops to break all the shields of the soldiers.
 
 
Other (NG+?): If you break the onyx shields of the soldiers, then leave the
battle arena and then return back from the normal entrance. When you return, all
the soldiers that had shields will begin to "surf" around on their shields along
the arena floor. They can only be killed by grab and kill attacks under these
conditions. (c: findlestick)

positioning your arm correctly you can get to Helios without Kratos stopping
once during the whole trip.


Sequence break (NG): skip Helios door

After getting the Head of Helios, you can clip through the stone blocks to the
right of Helios' body by grabbing onto a low ledge of the lower box and climbing
it. From there, you can go fully out of bounds and Glide past the door blocking
your way, plus also skip a little bit of navigation this way. (c: findlestick)

Sequence break (NG+): skipping most of Path of Eos v1

There's a very curious collision flaw on the stony ledge above the Path of Eos
doorway. Jump up to the ledge, then double jump and Glide against a certain spot
to start Sky Jump and boost Kratos very high in air. From there you can directly
Jet Dash ahead to skip nearly all of the Path of Eos. (c: satvara)

Sequence break (NG+): skipping most of Path of Eos v2

An alternative way to do this skip is to reveal the large door after Helios.
After it has been revealed it gets a ledge above it, so do a high jump, grab the
ledge and climb up. From the top of the door area, you can Jet Dash to the right
for a fairly wide platform that you can use to re-orient Kratos and do another
Jet Dash to the area where the Wraiths are, before the Icarus vent.

Sequence break (NG): skipping most of Path of Eos on NG

First of all, reveal the door using the Head of Helios. Then, there's a small
ledge you can grab and climb on top of to the left of the big door. Hold X while
Kratos is climbing up to activate double Glide jump, and when Kratos falls down,
get ready to Glide towards the revealed door and double jump to grab a ledge on
top of it. From on top of the door you can jump to the above cliff and use the
same Sky Jump spot that one of the above Path of Eos skip methods uses.

Since you don't have Jet Dash at this point in a NG run yet, doing the full skip
is trickier. You have to extend the Sky Jump by moving L-stick and make a wild
guess as to where it's safe to land down to skip most of the level. But still,
it's cool that this full skip IS possible to do even on New Game. (c: AKheon,

Sequence break (NG+): another, smaller shortcut can be done outside the Path of
Eos by doing a light double jump towards the stone block to the right of the
gate, so that Kratos grabs on to a ledge on its side and sinks inside the
ground. From there, letting go of Jet Dashing in a precise way can send Kratos a
bit deeper in Path of Eos very fast, but it's not a big sequence break.

room already. Grab an enemy sentry and do the circle mini-game variation. When
Kratos starts dashing holding the enemy, you can momentarily run through the

will let Kratos just barely reach a ledge on the other side. (c: findlestick)

Speed strategy: the Harpy fight is not necessary to fight, though targeting the
door with HoH might be difficult with all the harpies around.


Speed strategy (NG+): instead of using the head to reveal and disappear the door

Jet Dash to the area past the horizontal climbing rope. (Thus also skipping the
rope climb section).

Sequence break: Wraiths skip v1

There are several methods for skipping the Wraith fight on the bridge. First
method goes like this: using either a "Wraith jump" to the previously spawned
Wraiths, Kratos can climb on top of the shelves to the left before you step on
the bridge. Once on the shelves, you can get enough height to breach the ceiling
and Glide to the big heat vent. (c: satvara)

Alternatively, you can (on NG+) do a Severe Judgment jump on the same shelf or
grab a secret ledge that is behind the shelf at roof level.

Videos:
1, satvara's vid of this method (using Wraith jump):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWFRByy57Y#t=45


Sequence break: Wraiths skip v2 and v3

Once you hit the loading trigger at the corner leading to the shelves, you can
backtrack to hit a sky jump spot. The spot's position is hard to describe, but
basically you have to backtrack until you reach a bit of wooden floor, then jump
forward and try to hit the ledge ahead near the center. Not sure if casting
Claws magic is necessary at the moment of hitting the ledge as well.

If the trick works out, Kratos is sent high in the air, like usual with Sky
Jump. From there you can do some tricky navigating to reach the big heat vent.
(c: findlestick)

A faster Sky Jump can also be done at the corner leading to the bridge. (v3)

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBG5PBtWBDw


Sequence break: other Wraiths skip methods

There's a slow and experimental method of skipping the Wraiths fight on NG+.
After hitting the loading trigger at the corner leading to the shelves, have
Kratos Jet Dash to the left over the chasm a bit and then Rage downwards until
he hits death collision. If you have infinite health, you can now run on top of
the death collision. This enables you to backtrack / move right until Kratos
falls down to a new heat vent area. Yes, it turns out the game has loaded the
next part of the map to the area where you previously came from!

This lets you reach the vent sequence from the wrong direction, skipping the
Wraiths fight. Note that for the vent sequence to lead anywhere, you also have
to hit a loading trigger near the base of the vent, so don't get dragged in it
too early while falling down.

As another note, you can also leave during the Wraiths battle by doing some form
of CG high jump towards the chain. However this method is redundant due to the
quicker skips available.

Other: Teleportation Trigger and The Chain of Balance’s actual location.
Trigger location: as Kratos flies to the top of the final room at Eos.
Actual location of The Chain of Balance: underneath the last Pandora statue
Kratos spoke with (as shown in the first video, above at “other Wraiths skip
methods”).


<The Chain of Balance>

Speed strategy (NG+): it's possible to Jet Dash on the lowermost level to cut a
few corners when going to the first climbing wall. On the higher level, you can
Jet Dash straight to the grapple point. As a bonus, one of the falling rocks is
noticeably stuck in air later on, looking silly.
 
 
Other: sometimes at the end of the 2nd flight part Kratos won't reach the
Caverns but instead falls back down again, to his death.

If this happens while having infinite health, Kratos breaks out from the Caverns
cutscene and starts to fall back down the chain while out of sight. The camera
then also starts to go in reverse (back down the chain), RoS speeds this process
up. Eventually he will stop at a certain point down the chain, and all you'll
hear is Kratos grunting and 'hurring' until restart. (c: findlestick)

<The Caverns>

Other (NG+): If you shoot the brambles at the first box, and then do a high jump
onto the area above the burning brambles, Kratos will grab a ledge and stand up
on it. The box that you are supposed to ride on then goes away like normal but
without Kratos on it. When the box arrives at its destination, the camera stays
fixed on it while Kratos is stuck miles away. You can only hear him moving
around while he's stranded even on restart.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksFXLo5iRE#t=133


Sequence break (NG+): It’s possible to skip the first box-ride, as well as
starting the second box-ride early. Shoot the brambles to put the first box into
motion. Then Jet Dash to the left until you see the prompt belonging to the
first grapple point at the second box. Activate the grapple and then Jet Dash
off-screen to land on the second box. Burn the brambles to prematurely start the
second box-ride with Kratos on it. (c: findlestick)

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_0ng3dVoc


Other: another box glitch is to restart after reaching the first stop. Now
Kratos is able to shoot the next brambles through a wall from down below and
thus skip getting on the box for the box ride. This causes the camera to be
displaced during the ride, and naturally it's quite difficult for Kratos to
fight enemies while stranded on the wrong box. It's thus impossible to get past
the point where the minotaurs appear to break the chain. (c: findlestick)

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://youtu.be/SqXJ3tGMsYI?t=79


Sequence break (NG+): it is in fact possible to skip most of this visit to The
Caverns by doing a precise Jet Dash that ends with a Death collision jump. So,
Infinite health is a requirement.

From the highest swinging grapple, at the second box that has brambles, do a Jet
Dash along the left-side of the box closest to Kratos. Go around its front until
you reach that box’s bottom-right corner; the Chain of Balance is located
directly above this point, very high-up. Do a Death collision jump directly up
until Kratos goes through, and ends-up standing on, the platform at the base of
the chain. Then do a Sorrow Jump to get on the chain. (c: findlestick)

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-nxQnFPshI


Sweet spot: enemies won't notice you that well at the corners of the box.


Other (NG+): you can shoot a pre-emptive Nemesis Rage at the chain the two
Minotaurs are about to chop off. During the cutscene, the Minotaurs get
interrupted by the damage, but that doesn't stop the chain from getting broken
regardless.
 
 
Collision flaw: rarely a Minotaur can get stuck inside the large chain in the
middle. It flickers while trying to reach Kratos, turning around on the spot.
Eventually it can break out again.


Untested: It might be possible to do a Magneto Jump from the battle at the final
box, to magnetically grab the ledge that belongs to the box that Hermes appears
on, above. It’s certainly within Magneto Jump’s range. §
 
 
Wasted potential (NG+): you can Jet Dash to the entrance you'll come to later,
but nothing is loaded there.


Sequence break (NG): skip meeting Hermes (c: findlestick): 

The Hermes intro can be skipped, by firstly, standing on a small piece of
collision on the crane that carries the box you're on, as the final battle is
ending. The base of the crane has four small sections sticking out of it, you
can stand on these.

The crane will take you very high-up. From there, you have to do a Double-glide
long jump to the chain. The angle that you need to lean your L-controller during
your long jump is between 205 - 210 degrees (approx). The long jump is done
completely off-screen. When you reach the chain - due to the camera angle - your
controls will be in reverse. So, to go up, you have to lean the L-controller
down.

IMPORTANT: when you first land on the chain, I recommend grappling down to its
base, and then mash 'X' to go up the chain, until you hit the trigger that loads
the next area (as opposed to immediately attacking up-the-chain). If you
immediately go up too fast, the next area isn't loaded, and you'll be teleported
to a void of unloaded nothingness. But once you see Kratos appear at MT Olympus,
you can proceed to go up the chain as fast as you want (attacking up-the-chain).

The crane takes you up so high that you can also long jump directly to the
trigger that takes you to the MT Olympus chain section. But doing this causes
the MT Olympus section to not load, and you fall through a void to your death.
So you *have to* hit that trigger while you are actually climbing the chain in
The Caverns.

During a New Game, you have just one attempt at doing this skip. The reason for
this is that if you restart, you'll be checkpoint-ed very high up off-screen,
but the crane that took you up there is no longer loaded. So on restart, the
game gives you no available jumps, and you'll drop to the box below.

So after a restart, you can do one single glide, but Kratos is in some strange
state where he's affected by invisible walls surrounding the box, while in air.
Invisible walls that normally don't apply to him.

However, on NG+ not all is lost if you have to restart, thanks to having
Jet-Dash. So, when you restart you can still get to the chain without any
annoying invisible walls stopping you.

Sequence break (NG+): skip meeting Hermes

The first Hermes cutscene can be skipped by going around the cutscene trigger.
You can either walk on the edge of the box from the left or just Jet Dash to the
platform near the chain. After that, you need Sorrow Jump to jump on top of the
chain, since the part you can climb onto starts higher than you'd think.

Unfortunately this version of the skip is not possible on NG because of the last
jump. There is no way to gain such height at this point in the game yet.

Other: bypassing the Hermes cutscene trigger

There’s a very simple method to bypass the trigger that begins the Hermes
cutscene. Walk along the side of the box that Hermes is on, then simply drop
onto the floor while aiming with the bow and then roll towards Hermes (if you
don’t have Hermes boots, you can simply roll off the edge of the box towards
Hermes, without aiming with the bow). That’s it. You can then go and examine
Hermes' character model as he walks around yawning. He doesn’t have any solid
collision when you attack him, though I haven’t tested to see if attacking him
at this point affects anything when you formally fight him later-on. (c:
findlestick)

Could this trigger bypass-tactic also work at other cutscene triggers around the
game with a similar setup? Like at Skorpion?


<Chamber of the Flame>
 
Other (NG+): if you jump back on the chain and visit the mountain screen, then
come back, the game will freeze in one of the Hermes cutscenes.


Wasted potential (NG+): using a wall breach to the right of the locked door, you
can go out of bounds and see what's behind it early. Unfortunately nothing is
loaded there at the moment...
 
 
Other (NG+) (PS3): This is the point from where you will skip straight to the
end of the game if you had performed the "Early chain break" earlier on. After
climbing up the chain, you'll notice that you can instantly access the upstairs
area and turn the crank all the way. Since the game thinks you are turning the
crank for the second time, the game will then load the cutscene of Kratos
pulling up the Labyrinth. And after that, you get to fight Zeus… (c:
findlestick)
 
 
Sequence break (NG+): go to Hermes early / Flame of Olympus cutscene skip

You can skip having to reveal the images on the wall with Head of Helios and
also the entire Hermes conversation by high jumping onto the broken pillar that
Hermes is supposed to break, and from there you can jump to the balcony area
before the climbing grapple wall, everything after that loads normally.
 
On PS3, only do this skip after triggering the Athena cutscene at the blue
flame. If not, the game crashes either at the swinging grapple, or if you skip
it, at the ledge that leads around the corner of the building.

On PS4, the game won’t crash, and from on-top-of the pillar, you can also do the
Hermes skip described below, to skip to the upper Chamber of the Flame.

Videos:

Cutscene Skip? (NG+): It's possible to jump over the trigger that plays the
Hermes conversation where he's flicking a coin in the air, by using Sorrow Jump.
But that trigger is also active near the area where you would need to high jump
to grab a ledge to get to the next area, making the jump extremely difficult.

Other / Sequence Break (NG /NG+): skip Hermes Boots

There's a glitched ledge that allows Sky Jump right at the start of the section
where you chase after Hermes. When jumping down from the Chamber of the Flame,
glide towards the outer rim of the gray outdoors platform instead of trying to
land on it. There's a spot that can send Kratos high up in air, allowing you to
reach the upper level of the Chamber early. From the upper Chamber you can
continue on towards the direction of the Music Room, and things will load
normally. If this skip is done before the Flame of Olympus cutscene, you must
hit the ledge completely blind, which can be difficult.

This probably isn't such a good speedrun tactic on NG since Hermes Boots are
needed for doing many critical tricks later on. Also, you might even get stuck
later in the game if you don't have the Boots. However, on NG+ this is a useful
skip for a speedrun that doesn’t utilize the Early Chain Break glitch. (c:

        https://youtu.be/e4TziyGFEh0


Speedrun Strategy: making the first climbing wall faster
 
Method 1: At the grapple wall (just before the swinging grapple), you can roll
at the top of the grapple wall and fall down its side, from there you can Glide
over the swinging grapple and make it to the bridge rather swiftly. If done
correctly, you skip some climbing and also the small cutscene of the rock
breaking a part of the bridge. If you have a problem with Kratos not jumping
when you need him to, try to use your double jumps a bit earlier during the
fall. (c: findlestick)

Method 2 (NG+): This is a much faster way, just Jet Dash from the top of the
building where the rail is broken and directly to the bridge. (c: findlestick)

Wasted Glitch Potential (NG+): If you do the above mentioned skip (with the Jet
Dash) but go too far past the point where the first rock hits the bridge, you'll
skip a loading trigger. This results in you being able to move quickly across
the entire length of the bridge without it falling, you can hear civilians
screaming, but cannot see them. You can still climb the ledges (with strange
camera angles), but the floor of the next area never loads.
 
 
Speed strategy (NG+): at the end of the bridge area, high jump over the wooden
post and simply Jet Dash to the next section. Make sure to land near the start
of the next walkable section, otherwise you skip a vital loading trigger and you
will get stuck. (c: findlestick)

the end of the bridge and making a "Beeline" to the door. However, the door has
an invisible wall of collision that Kratos cannot go past. At that stage, Hermes
runs past Kratos.
 
 
Sequence break (NG+): From the ladder to the left of where Hermes enters, you
can quickly rocket up and get to the upper area by using Ladder Jump. A good
consequence of this is that you skip a loading trigger, and as a result you
don't have to see Hermes run across the tightrope towards the big Athena statue.
Everything loads normally after doing all this. (c: findlestick)

Other (NG?): if you use ladder jump to skip over certain loading triggers on the
way to the catapult, you then cause the catapult to malfunction in various ways.
For example, when you rotate the catapult, the game will suddenly load two
entire catapults that are in two different positions: one is loaded in the
position it was before rotating the catapult, the other in the position after
the rotation. These catapults are superimposed onto each other, one has
collision and a functional R1 prompt. The other catapult has no collision nor is
it functional.
 
If you R1 the catapult that works - Kratos will do his normal mini-game - except
that at the end of the animation (where he clings to the flying boulder) the
next cutscene won't load, and instead Kratos breaks out and suddenly ends up
back at the two catapults. From there you can R1 the catapult endlessly and keep
breaking out of the full animation. Or R1 the catapult and spam buttons, this
will cause the next 'Athena Statue' cutscene to play and everything then loads
as normal, or Kratos breaks out just as the cutscene kicks in. This gets you
stuck, because Kratos is still back at the location where the catapult was (but
now ALL graphics but Kratos are unloaded) and Kratos ends up falling into
unloaded nothingness! (c: findlestick)

Wasted Glitch Potential (NG+): At the catapult that Kratos uses to get to
Hermes. You can get inside the catapult area early (before it's rotated in
Hermes' direction) simply by pulling the crank almost to the end. And then
quickly Jet Dashing to the opening. Unfortunately, you can't shoot the catapult
in some strange direction because the R1 function is not active at that time.

<Grand Vestibule>
 
Cutscene skip (NG+): by Sorrow Jumping, you can go above the cutscene in which
Hermes confronts Kratos, saying "I will not be bested by a mortal!". It can be
activated later on for some ghostly fun - the audio plays, but no one is there.

Speed strategy (NG+): If you go to the Grand Vestibule save point during the
fight with Hermes (possible with Boots) and make a checkpoint, after retry
Hermes stands completely still, takes less damage to defeat, and you skip his
death speech as an added bonus. (c: AKheon)

You might be able to stop Hermes in strange positions or locations for even more
glitch potential.

Wasted glitch potential: can't spare Hermes

It's possible to leave the Hermes battle arena early by doing a Sorrow Jump from
the very left (foreground), and land on a ledge. From that ledge you can simply
Jet Dash out-of-bounds and get around the invisible wall of collision that
normally stops your progress. You can then get to the next/upper area by using
satvara's "collision breach method" that can normally be used to skip the Hermes
Boots tutorial (see below for more info).
 
This would have been a good speedrun strategy...however this is all in vain
because the next area is still not loaded at this late stage. Sorry Hermes… (c:

Other: In very rare occasions, Hermes can get stuck at the end of his fight.
This only happens when he dies near one of two spots in the arena, but the exact
reasons are unknown. When this happens, there is nothing you can do to unglitch
him. Attacking him does nothing, the only way to fix this is to restart
checkpoint.

Wasted potential / Speed strategy (NG): During the Boots of Hermes tutorial
fight, the wooden wall can't be traversed using the Boots. However, if you use
the Boots of Hermes immediately after the last enemy dies, you can climb the
wall during the small cutscene, enabling a small timesave.

Videos:

Sequence break: you can skip the Boots tutorial fight (and a small scene after
it), using a wall breach and a secret ledge at the top of the statue's head.
This can also be done by high jumping and grabbing the ledge of the wooden
structure at the savepoint, or by simply doing a Jest Jump up to any of the
higher platforms. (c: satvara)

Upper Chamber of the Flame, but at the price of the Chamber itself not loading.
 
 
<Upper Chamber of the Flame>
 
Sequence break: skip Siren hallway scene

It’s possible to prevent the Siren scene from starting. It’s done by Jet Dashing
through the scene’s trigger in a particular way. It’s an inconsistent glitch to
do and very hard to reproduce. On PS3, it’s supposedly easier to do, perhaps due
to loading-times?

Videos:
1, Jolielegal’s vid:
    https://youtu.be/ScVQMrjGpQA


Other: At the bottom of the stairs after the Siren, there is a collision flaw
where Kratos can clip through. Maybe it could be used to do the Music puzzle
skip described below, if it were consistent.

Videos:
1, Jolielegal’s vid:
    https://youtu.be/4-MeBA8IDVM


Sequence break: skip Music Puzzle

You can skip the entire music puzzle by jumping out-of-bounds from the top of
the cylindrical stairs and by falling under the floor near the gate of the
puzzle. This lands you at the savepoint that's before Hercules. The Hercules'
area is not yet loaded, to remedy this, just climb the stairs and go to the end
of the hall and then return. On PS3 there is an extremely long pause before the
Hercules area loads. (c: findlestick)

Another variation to doing this skip is by doing a wall breach at the bottom of
the stairs instead. You have to do a small high jump and Jet Dash towards the
foreground from the foot of the stairs (where's the chest). At a certain spot
the wall gives way and Kratos flies out of bounds. But this method is slightly
riskier because the camera does not always cooperate, and this collision flaw is
more difficult to utilize than the one at the top of the stairs.

On PS3 there is a disturbingly long pause again later when you climb to the
Upper Chamber via the big chain as well. You can turn the crank at the blue
flame later in the game, even though you skip the music puzzle. (c: findlestick)

There exists a third version which also skips the Siren scene in the hallway,
leading-up to the Music Puzzle. It's done by breaching the floor with Magneto
Jump, at a chest located to the left-of-the doorway that leads to the Siren.
Then drop through the floor to land on some solid collision out-of-bounds
directly underneath that chest. From there, Jet Dash out-of-bounds towards some
lights to the right, when you reach those lights you'll be at the Savepoint
before Hercules. And as above, you have to go up that spiral staircase to hit
the trigger that loads the Hercules Arena. (c: findlestick)

Speed Strategy: At the music puzzle you can get up to the upper area that has
the turning mechanisms without having to use the air vents on the sides by doing
a Jet Dash ("Jet Ascension") against the front of the music puzzle.
 
 
Wasted potential (NG+): you can skip the scene of the elevator doors closing by
doing Sorrow Jump from on top of the chest. However, the area leading to the
Forum will not load if you do this!
 
 
Wasted potential (NG+): after completing the music puzzle, you can visit the
chain from which you climbed earlier, and after returning, the stairway and the
pillars have no collision at first. Hitting a certain trigger on the lower floor
will load the collision back up again, but the game is now prone to crashing
during the upcoming cutscenes or if you try to access The Forum after doing
this, so... don't.

 
Wasted potential (NG+): if you decided to skip Hermes, it's recommended you do
not activate his cutscenes after returning here later in the game because that
will only cause trouble for you.

Hermes appearance cutscene itself is glitched, with Hermes absent from it. After
that, going to turn the big crank at the flame will load a wrong cutscene!
Instead of the Three Judges holding on to the chain, you'll get the same
cutscene as before with Athena chatting with Kratos. After that, Kratos will get
stuck in place forever.

Other: Teleportation Trigger and The Forum's actual location.
Trigger location: just beyond the Savepoint that leads to The Forum.
Actual location of The Forum: from the top of the spiralling staircase before
The Forum, High Jump over the wall and then Jet Dash with your L-controller
leaning in a direction of about 65 degrees. Your Jet Dash's natural descent
should get you there, you’ll hear flies buzzing intensify as you get closer. (c:
findlestick)


<The Forum & Hercules>

Wasted potential: you can't take a Wraith with you to the Hercules fight arena
as it will unspawn when the map changes at the bottom of the stairs.

 
Speedrun Strategy: You can skip having to walk down the spiralling stairs simply
by jumping out-of-bounds next to the stairs. This will land you right next to
the savepoint. (c: findlestick)
 
 
Sequence break: Skip Hercules (c: findlestick)
 
It's possible to skip the long cutscene with Hercules as well as 99.99% of the
fight! Firstly, the fight intro cutscene can be skipped by high jumping up onto
a ledge above the arena entrance and then doing a wide arc around the cutscene
trigger by Jet Dashing. If you then go near the front of the arena while out of
bounds, you hit a trigger that makes 7 brightly colored geometric shapes appear
on the arena floor. After returning to the arena, you'll find out that 6 of
these shapes have a R1-prompt to them, and they almost act like a remote
controller for the fight.
 
What each R1-prompt does:
1. Black one on the far left: Resets the entire fight from scratch.
2. Orange one on the left: Resets the "1st phase of Hercules".
3. Green one in the middle: Resets "Hercules without a helmet" phase.
4. Purple one on the right: Resets "Hercules without helmet or gauntlets" phase.
5. Black one on the far right: Starts the final Hercules cutscene.
6. Orange one at the entrance: Opens a hole in the floor collision, but nothing
   seems to load under there until you kill Hercules.
7. Orange at the back: This one has no prompt (at this date).
 
Note: Once a particular R1 prompt is activated, all other R1 prompts will no
longer appear. But you can reset these boxes back during the battle by leaving
the battle arena and returning via Jest Jump/Combat Grapple jumping using any of
the undead enemies. (Remember, the geo-boxes will only appear when you reach
certain out-of-bounds areas. It's recommended to exit towards the southern side
of the battle arena and return).
 
So, the fastest way to skip this fight would be to skip the Hercules cutscene
trigger, and then press the Black geo-box on the right to make Hercules go
directly to his final mini-game battle (where he flips the arena up). This can
be done on NG too because a RoS high jump is enough to land on the invisible
ledge above the doorway.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBup1EQwPQ


Other: glitching the Hercules fight using the geometric shapes

Some interesting combinations of glitches can be done with the cutscene skip and
the geometric shapes. For example, it's possible to drag Hercules all the way to
the savepoint during the 1st phase of Hercules, if you had earlier skipped the
Hercules cutscene where the gate normally gets closed. There is a boundary in
that hallway where strange things can happen when Kratos and Hercules interact
with each other while crossing it.
 
Hercules can also be made to break-out from his rock throwing animation by
R1'ing a geo-box during his throw, this will cause the rock to land and remain
on the arena. If you then happen to make Hercules restart his rock throwing
phase after all this - and damage him enough to go and grab a rock - he will
either:
 
(a) Grab a rock from a wall like he normally would.
(b) Go to the wall and try to grab a rock where there no longer is a one, this
     causes him to just run aimlessly against a wall forever.
(c) He will detect the rock that is on the arena floor (due to the previous
breakout) and he will very strangely bury his entire body into the arena
floor and grab the rock and throw it. At times he will be standing up very
high in mid air when he throws this rock.

You can also make all of the enemies including Hercules drop down an open hole
near the entrance of the arena if you had earlier R1'ed the orange geo-box near
the entrance.

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si6DeEnGlQQ
 
 
Random: There's no collision over where Hera and Hercules are staying, so if you
try to go there you just fall through the floor. However, if you skipped the
Hercules cutscene earlier and then trigger the start of the game with the
geometric shapes, there seems to be some collisions that you can stand on next
to Hercules up on the Podium that Hera watches from. You can attack Hercules,
but of course no damage can be inflicted on him at this stage.
 
 
Random: tidbits from around the fight
 
At the end of the second phase, Hercules stuns Kratos momentarily and turns away
to brag at Hera. If there's something that deals damage for a long time on the
battlefield (like Nemesis Rage bolt) Kratos might wake up from the stun only to
notice Hercules is about to plant a fist in his face.
 
As Kratos steals Hercules' weapons from him, if you keep L1 pressed down after
QTE ends, Kratos gets to keep his old weapon of choice at least a while longer
during the fight.
 

Other: On rare occasions, Hercules will not kill all the grunts in the arena
when he is supposed to. This happens when Hercules is in the air during the
animation of being impaled on the wall. The result is that when Hercules is
supposed to kill the grunts, he falls to the ground instead, which cancels his
attack. You can progress the fight normally, but the grunts will stay in the
arena until the end of the fight, which can be annoying.

Videos:
1, Jolielegal’s vid:
    https://youtu.be/0iRlJ2TJMp0


Sequence break (NG): The entire last phase of the fight against Hercules (after
Kratos gets the Cestus) can be skipped. To do this, hit Hercules with triangle
attacks while he is "stretching" his arm, so that he is pushed back against the
wall. You must make him hit the wall to get the skip. If the skip succeeds,
Hercules will grab Kratos and immediately start the final sequence of the fight.

Videos:

    https://youtu.be/hf-OOGrtC2c


Random: For those squeamish of violence, you can opt to not punch Hercules in
the face at all. Eventually the game automatically makes Kratos punch Hercules
so that they both fall through the floor. Hercules' face will be completely
smashed regardless at the very end, and this is some seconds slower than just
punching the guy.
 
 
<Sewers>

Other: Swimming glitch (Sewers), backtrack to Hercules Arena (c: findlestick):

If you activate air-swimming glitch without going too far into the Sewers, you
avoid a trigger that unloads the Hercules arena. This lets you backtrack with
air-swim-glitch active, and you can explore the Hercules arena, Chamber of the
Flame, Music Puzzle, Hermes chase, Mt Olympus chain and The Caverns 1st visit.

The setup for this is to immediately backtrack into the water as soon as
Hercules is dead. Then breach the water's surface, and bypass the
underwater-gate so you enter the exit-tunnel. From there, double-jump and
side-Dash so that you touch some water and Kratos enters 'water
surface-swimming'. From there you can swim directly upwards and backtrack to
Hercules arena.

Some things that you can do when you backtrack include:

-activating the loading triggers at the Mt Olympus-chain in the wrong order, as
to load Mt Olympus and The Caverns simultaneously in the same space, so they
overlap. This can also be done with Mt Olympus and the Chamber of the Flame, but
these don't overlap.

-replay The Caverns 1st visit, since it reloads anew when backtracking. You can
reach the “prompt” where you assemble the Labyrinth, after the Skorpion, but the
prompt isn't active yet. 

You can find the starting-position of the box that Hermes introduces himself.
It’s up very high, immediately to the right of the second box with brambles.
However, landing on it doesn't yet load the Hermes appearance scene, yet.

-at the Chamber of the Flame, there is a secret R1-prompt out-of-bounds behind
the wall at the climbable chain. This R1-prompt loads the Chamber of the Flame
so that the stairs appear, and so that Pandora's Box is at the upper-Chamber of
the Flame.

-there is a model of Hermes in T-pose, wearing a black costume, out-of-bounds
far behind the secret R1-prompt mentioned above.

-you can get to the Hermes arena in reverse from the Chamber of the Flame, but
Hermes doesn't appear. Doing this causes the Sirens to shoot crazy lights all
over the place. The R1-prompt at the catapult can be activated while swimming,
but the cutscene doesn't play. If you then swim to Hermes, you get a glitched,
black "scene" but Hermes remains on the Athena statue.

-you can solve the sword puzzle-section of the Music Puzzle, but the game won't
respond to your inputs during the actual musical mini-game. You can activate the
prompts at the upper-area as the mini-game starts but nothing happens of note.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid of air-swimming backtrack, and of some of the things
mentioned above:
        https://youtu.be/vhZMNfKxwsw

 
Sequence break: It's possible to go around the gate blocking the Sewers exit by
activating an easy swimming glitch, but the teleport trigger that takes Kratos
to the next area is not there until you have pulled the exit switch. The next
area does exist, but without a convenient teleport trigger you have to swim
quite a long distance to reach it.

For precise directions, do this. First swim through the exit tunnel to load a
new camera angle. Enter the menu for a second to clean up the messy OoB
background residue to see things clearer, then start swimming up and towards the
foreground for over a minute... also a little to the right. Eventually you see
the next map's objects and lights floating in the distance, so just swim there
and you're set.

This skip allows you to keep regen magic if you have it. While doing this skip
is slower than the other regen magic / fight skip listed below, it is extremely
easy and reliable to do, and looks pretty crazy... might be useful in a single
segment run if you want to play it safe.

So far it's not possible to do additional sequence breaks at Poseidon's Chamber
while swimming, so you have to end the swimming at the entrance. (c:
findlestick)

Regen magic (and fight skip): When approaching the Nemean Roar tutorial battle
room, you can stay to the left-hand side of the corridor and at the very end do
a high jump towards the switch. Keep Jet Dashing 'til you breach the wall. From
there you can operate the exit switch early, prompting a horde of onyx shielders
to appear like usual. Smash the onyx shielders' shields, so that they turn
normal, then "Jest Jump" or CG high jump using one of them, all the while
avoiding activating the regen magic battle trigger. Jet Dash to the exit
afterwards. (c: satvara)
 
This allows you to not only keep regenerating magic (until Nemesis Whip tutorial
at least, but that too can be skipped), but you are able to switch weapons at
will (because you skipped the part which locks Kratos' weapon to Cestus).

There exists a second method to do this skip, which is also faster. Use Magneto
Jump to grab the ledge belonging to the lever’s base, breach the floor and Jet
Dash to the exit tunnel.

        https://youtu.be/5Bb5_I2A5m0?t=239
 
 
Random: If you activate the regen magic battle while having the horde of onyx
shielders around, the actual regen magic fight will have maybe 3 or 4 enemies,
then their spawning stops. This causes you to get stuck, because the blue walls
never dissipate around the room after having won.
 
 
Speedrun Strategy: After the Cestus tutorial, you can easily jump over the
shielded soldiers by doing an ascension followed by a simple Dash.


Other: Teleportation Trigger and Poseidon Chamber's actual location.
Trigger location: upon exiting the tunnel.
Actual location of Poseidon's Chamber: air-swim to where Hercules' corpse is,
then go directly back to where Hercules arena was previously loaded, but about
twice as high-up. Then keep your controller at 225 degrees and do about six
Swim-rushes. (c: findlestick)
 
 
<Poseidon's Chamber>
 
Collision flaw: you can get outside bounds right at the start by finding two
chests in the foreground and doing a high jump from on top of them towards the
camera. Kratos is able to climb a ledge there.


Sequence break: by using the aforementioned ledge, you can jump and Jet Dash
over the intro cutscene & fight. You can Dash all the way up to the watery room
with spikes, but it's more difficult than landing inside the preceding corridor.
In this case you skip meeting Poseidon Princess, but this is not a real time
save: upon returning, you'll still stumble upon the cutscene. But at least it
looks glitched (with Princess absent) for maximum mayhem.

This skip is possible on NG as well, but you need to squeeze everything out of
the height of your jump. First do a "slightly higher double jump" and follow it
up with a RoS high jump. (c: AKheon)

Videos:
1, AKheon's vid (NG strategy):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFS3HVe0oGM


Wasted glitch potential: after pulling the crank for the first time, you can try
Jet Dashing through the temporarily open exit gate... but there's collision in
front of it.


Collision flaw: you can access Poseidon Princess' room early by jamming Kratos
between the pillar and the side of the gate in front of the room. Then keep
Summoning Olympus Archers, as you jump in-between the pillar and the gate,
eventually Kratos will be pushed out-of-bounds and you can glide into the
Poseidon Princess’ room. This isn't generally useful because trying to use the
blue portal at this stage will only cause Kratos to fall into his demise in the
spike pool, and it isn't possible to leave the room any other way either.
 
 
Wasted glitch potential: it's possible to reach the last area of Poseidon's
Chamber early, but you won't see the Pandora cutscene nor will the next area
load. It seems that the trigger for the Pandora cutscene is in the woman getting
crushed... but it's unknown thus far what is the trigger for the next area
loading. Some sequence break might still be possible when we know more.

 
Speed strategy: you can get to the first switch in the water spike room by doing
Jet Dash from the stairs.


Random (swimming): pulling the switch that spawns Feral Hounds will freeze
Kratos in place. But you regain movement if you retry from the last checkpoint.


Wasted Glitch Potential: At the dog kicking puzzle, you can't Jet Dash through
the portal under the lowering platform on first arrival, due to collision in
front of it. But it doesn't matter anyway since you can't use the portal in
Poseidon Princess room without the Princess dying until the lowering platform is
at a correct level.


Random (swimming): you can play the Feral Hound part surprisingly far even if
you're swimming. The Hounds can be lured to jump through the portal by their own
volition, and eventually when the platform is low enough you can go and fetch
Poseidon's Princess to get her on the platform. Unfortunately after that point
Kratos freezes on the spot again and you can't proceed.


Random (swimming): the cutscene where Kratos frees Poseidon Princess can glitch
up visually if Kratos is swimming. His animations happen at an angle and he can
completely miss Poseidon Princess this way.


Wasted Glitch Potential: when Kratos has freed the Princess, you can return to
the platform-room without using the portal. This is done by jamming Kratos in a
gap located in-between the pillar at the far-left of the room, and the rear
wall. Keep Summoning Olympus Archers as you repeatedly jump, and occasionally
evading into this gap. Eventually Kratos will be pushed out-of-bounds and you
can Jet Dash to the platform-room. When you get there, you won’t see the
Princess or any dogs there. All you see is the platform shaking violently.

If you then enter the portal leading to the Poseidon Princess room, Kratos will
enter the room normally. Reentering the platform-room via the portal results in
the game proceeding as normal. (c: findlestick)
 
 
Random: on the wall there is a painting of a wimpy-looking Kratos fighting an
indifferent looking Ares, and a painting of wimpy Kratos killing "Icarus"
(Actually, this Icarus painting is there twice! But the second one is placed
off-camera since they never considered that anyone would ever see the replica
painting.) The finer details of these paintings can be better appreciated thanks
to swimming glitch.


Trophy exploit: Killing the endlessly respawning dogs at this dog kicking puzzle
allows you to get the "Hitman Trophy" in addition to racking up some orbs from
combo bonuses. (c: vettefan88)

videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_AswCRLYEw


Other: the lowering platform can be fooled into rising all the way up even with
4 dogs on it by touching it very quickly and then jumping away.


Wasted potential: once you have four hounds on the Platform, it’s possible to
get to the Poseidon Princess room without using the portal. This is done by,
having earlier, summoned a Permanent Archer Soul on-top-of the lever, before
pulling it. Then once you have four Hounds on the platform, jump on the platform
to lower it some more. Then do a Magneto Jump at the lever to breach the floor,
and Jet Dash out-of-bounds to the other side of the large fence.

From there it’s possible to breach into the Poseidon Princess room by utilizing
the collision flaw mentioned a few paragraphs earlier. However, using the portal
inside the Poseidon’s Princess room to get to the dog-platform, will result in
seeing the Princess die as she falls into the spikes, despite having earlier
lowered the platform to, what should be, a safe level. (c: findlestick)


Random: if you return to Poseidon Princess room during the fight on the moving
platform, some dogs will occasionally disappear, perhaps by falling outside
bounds through the portal hole. Once when I did this, on returning to the
platform Kratos just fell down to the spikes - too many dogs had disappeared
since the last time Kratos was there.
 
 
Sequence break: Towards the end of the Dog Kicking puzzle (just after the girl
runs through the portal for the last time). You can completely skip the battle
with the 2 Bronze Taloses, simply by doing an ascension from the top of the
floor that moves up/down, and then Jet Dashing directly to the exit. (c:
findlestick)

An alternate method is to jump and then side Jet Dash beyond the gate from the
lower portal.
 
Videos:

Speed strategy (NG+): you can skip the last fight before setting the girl to her
demise by having Hephaestus' Ring turned on. Kratos turns the wheel so fast he
manages to get everything done before enemies even notice him. By the way,
during the actual cutscene Kratos is invincible to damage, so you don't have to
worry about enemies interrupting Kratos.


Speed strategy (NG): Activate Rage of Sparta when Kratos is turning the wheel,
and he will not be interrupted by the enemies.
 

Sequence Break (NG), Pandora Cutscene Skip:

You can skip the cutscene where Kratos speaks to the Pandora statue. It's done
by clipping out-of-bounds between the pillar and the jail bars outside the
Princess' room, near the two chests. Summoning Olympus Archers, as you jump
in-between the pillar and the jail bars, helps to push you out-of-bounds. Once
out-of-bounds, do a jet dash towards the underneath of the Dog Kicking-puzzle,
keep dashing in that direction until you reach the Nemesis bridge-puzzle. Which
is actually located much further below than the Poseidon Chamber than is
logical.

Sequence Break / Air-Swimming Glitch (NG), Skip everything to the first
Labyrinth Box:

It’s possible to skip everything from when you kill the Poseidon Princess, all
the way to the inside of the 1st Labyrinth Box. To do the skip, do a “Jump
Slightly Higher” + RoS-jump, to grab a ledge above the chests near the pool.
Then double jump, and glide down-and-through, one of the pillars next to the
pool, you’ll stand on collision out-of-bounds there, which you can then
Double-glide jump under the floor and touch water at one of the corners of the
small pool. Once you have air-swim glitch, swim all the way to the Caverns where
you can either do the Skorpion Skip (PS4 only), or end air-swimming by pulling
the lever at the pool room, or climb the grapple wall at that same location. (c:

Other: Teleportation Trigger and the Upper Gardens' actual location.
Trigger location: upon exiting Poseidon's chamber
Actual location of the Upper Gardens: far behind Pandora's statue, but much
lower.


<Upper Gardens>
 
Sequence Break: skip Cronos

When you reach the Upper Gardens you can skip the bridge puzzle as well as the
entire Cronos section. You also skip getting the Nemesis Whip, which is sort of
a bother on NG since doing some of the highest jumps becomes more difficult. But
with NG+ that's no concern. (c: satvara)

On NG+, you can also skip the entire Cronos section simply by activating the
bridge with Whip, since you already have it.

Random (swimming): If you have swimming glitch activated while in this area, you
can see the Olympian Gardens directly below. But it's not the "real" Olympian
Gardens, it's a simplistic/basic prototype of it. (A bit like "Alternate Steeds"
in GoW2, for those of you familiar with this glitch).
 
 
<Aphrodite's Chamber>
 
Other: Teleportation Trigger and The Forge’s actual location.
Trigger location: at the Portal leading to The Forge.
Actual location of The Forge: it’s far behind the Portal. Jet Dash from
on-top-of the Portal, or Air-swim in that direction for as long as two fully
charged Swim-rushes would take you. Then go up about ten-times Kratos’ height. I
should mention that its location is near where Poseidon’s Chamber was actually
loaded. (c: findlestick)


Wasted glitch potential: it's possible to use Sorrow Jump to grab a ledge high
above the closed Portal and jump into the portal itself. But the portal is not
functional at this time.


Other: Infinite Loading-loophole

This is a glitch that lets you infinitely reload every level from Realm of Hades
to Aphrodite's Chamber.

To do this, go to The Forge directly from Aphrodite’s Chamber without by Jet
Dashing from the top of Aphrodite's portal then Death Jumping high-up to an area
where The Forge actually is. The Forge is actually not located directly next to
Aphrodite’s Chamber. It’s located extremely high-up and much further away than
the level would suggest.

Once you reach The Forge -- and since you didn't use the portal -- you actually
reach The Forge in its 'post-Hades state' as opposed to its 'pre-Tartarus
state'. In short, reaching the post-Hades Forge means that you can infinitely
reload Realm of Hades (in its post-Hades state), post-Hades battle savepoint,
Olympia, Eos, Chain vent, Caverns, Lower Chamber of the Flame, Hermes, Upper
Chamber of the flame, Music Puzzle?, Hercules and Poseidon Princess. When you
replay a level, the game will either remember a level's previous state or it
will load it fully from scratch.

Levels which the game will remember its previous state:

-Forge (post-Hades state).

-Realm of Hades (post-Hades state).

-Music puzzle? (untested)

-Sewers

-Poseidon princess

-Upper Gardens?

All other levels are loaded fully as if you've reached them for the first time,
and seem to play normally. Lower Chamber of The Flame is unique in that some of
the paintings are both revealed and not-yet-revealed. You can also duplicate
Hercules ONCE after killing him on your second replay of the Hercules battle.
You can also get infinite Gorgon eyes, Feathers, horns and Godly Possessions
(untested).

After playing through these levels four times, the game regularly crashes,
particularly when restarting. Eventually my auto-save became corrupted. (c:
findlestick)

Aphrodite:
        https://youtu.be/6cDEWv19z5s


Other (swimming): Air-swimming with Aphrodite (c: findlestick)

You can trigger Aphrodite's first cutscene while swimming. Triggering
Aphrodite's initial cutscene whilst swimming makes Kratos break-out of the sex
mini-game, but only once you've selected 'Yes'. At which point the camera pans
to the two other women, but without the mini-game commencing. The camera is then
locked at that terrible angle but you can make it to the savepoint and restart
during this time. Restarting causes the camera to pan from the bed to the women
and you get a rare glimpse of Aphrodite in her mini-game pose.

If you then do the Infinite Loading-loophole (as mentioned above), and you reach
Aphrodite's chamber again, she's in her mini-game state, but for once you get a
good look at what she's actually doing. She writhes around, but the strangest
thing is that she slides around the room trying to avoid Kratos should he get
close to her. Some Hades Souls can register hits on her, at which point she
stops moving away from Kratos' advances. 

Here are some results of interacting with Aphrodite, in this state:

-She can be grappled with regular blades.

-Kratos gets knocked back if he tries Claw grapples on her.

-Arrows embed themselves into her body. Kratos regularly auto-targets her groin
for some reason?

-She can be hit by Nemesis Rage but it doesn't register damage.

-Cestus grapple: Kratos gets stuck in place for a few moments.

<The Forge & Tartarus>

Swimming glitch: if you want to explore Tartarus/Gates of Tisiphone, Aphrodite's
Chamber, Poseidon's Chamber, Daedalus' Study, Olympian Gardens, The Caverns and
so on while swimming, you ought to do swimming glitch here in the same way as
detailed earlier on in the FAQ: reach the water tunnel under The Forge outside
bounds, hit the water surface, then just swim out. Or start air-swimming at the
pool at Poseidon's Chamber.
 
Note 1: if you do this swimming glitch at this stage of the game, the portal to
Aphrodite will NOT let you through at first for some reason. So you have to get
behind/next to the portal (while out-of-bounds) and hit a certain trigger while
avoiding another. Only then will the game let you get through the portal! But
once you do that - strangely - the game will let you go through back and forth
like normal.
 
Note 2: if you want to take this swimming glitch beyond the Daedalus Study, I
recommend going there before getting swimming glitch and pulling the lever.
Namely because Kratos gets stuck if he pulls levers while swimming. (c:
findlestick)

Random (swimming): as you enter the door to Tartarus - Hephaestus unloads the
instant the door is closed. This was discovered thanks to swimming glitch.
 
 
Wasted glitch potential: the watery looking textures behind the chest and other
areas do not count as 'water', so getting swimming glitch by using them is not
possible.
 
 
Other (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated and the undead soldiers
try to "pack rush" and grab Kratos, they comically bounce off him due to Kratos'
swimmingness. The Centaur also never tries to engage Kratos in the mini-game due
to this.
 
 
<Gates of Tisiphone>
 
Wasted glitch potential (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated, it's
not possible to get the area behind the door/puzzle to load without at least
starting the puzzle. Which cannot be done while Kratos is swimming, he will not
R1 the chains. However a way was later found to open the gates and then return
to this area with swimming glitch intact, this is covered later on below just
after "Forge re-visit'... (c: findlestick)
 
 
Other: findle has reported to have breached the Gates of Tisiphone by high
jumping and then Alt-Jet Dashing around from on top of the chests on the upper
left hand side of the puzzle.


<Cronos>

Other: re-visiting Cronos with swimming glitch

It's possible to return to Cronos after having killed him once... only to find
him alive and well! The procedure itself is detailed below, in the section The
Forge re-visit, but the unique and bewildering effects this exploit has on
Cronos are detailed here.
 
Once you reach Gaia's hand, you will see Cronos suddenly appear standing far in
the background (his back towards the previous savepoint). He stands there
inactively asides from just panting, you can swim to him and explore him. In
between his feet there are 4 orbs floating in nothingness, one of the orbs has -
what look like - shadows of human souls on it, another orb looks similar to
planet Earth, and another has a blue flame shooting out of it. None of these
orbs have R1 prompts (unlike some other out-of-bounds objects in this game, f.e
at Hercules battle and outside Daedalus).
 
You will also hear the sound of Onyx breaking mysteriously when you get near
Gaia's hand. It also happens each time you restart from the hand checkpoint.
 
When activating the R1 prompt, the cutscene with Cronos will start...but
sometimes you actually see - normally unseen footage - of Crono's face close up
before he picks up Gaia's hand. It looks kinda creepy since you are not
expecting it, and especially since his face slowly emerges out of a totally
black background. It's almost as if you have caught the game with "its pants
down" as it's preparing Cronos for the start of his cutscene.
 
Unfortunately the game won't let you progress beyond the first mini-game with
Cronos while having swimming glitch, because you can't activate Head of Helios
when Kratos is in his swimming state…so you get stuck until restart.

You can also re-visit Cronos without swimming. So what happens is that Kratos
can get past that Head of Helios part, only to find out that Cronos lacks
collision... Kratos will fall down the instant the cutscenes are over. After a
while Kronos shifts into - what looks like - his next phase, but by then Kratos
is down near his feet and stuck there. (c: findlestick)

2, findlestick's vid (revisiting without swimming):
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8I29MbuHSc#t=294


Wasted glitch potential: At the first phase of Cronos' arm (below his wrist),
you can do a Jet Dash towards the Camera just as his arm becomes vertical. You
actually leave his wrist completely but at this date it does seem that you can't
skip to some upcoming section, or return to a previous section (before Cronos).
 
 
Speed strategy: You can "Jet Ascension" up between Cronos' fingers as he brings
them down to "squash you like a pest" so that you are at the top of his fingers
as soon as his hand has come down. (c: findlestick)
 
Videos:

Wasted glitch potential: At the first swinging grapple, you can swing and Jet
Dash and go behind that belt (with the onyx section). There is walkable
collision there, and you can use it as a battle exploit by killing the enemies
that are on the other side of it, while being totally safe. Unfortunately, after
you kill them it seems - at this date - impossible to return to the other side
due to invisible walls of collision.


Other: If you Jet Dash away from Cronos' palm before Cronos splats them
together. Kratos will appear from in between Cronos' palms, no matter how far
away Kratos was at the time of Cronos smacking his palms together.

Videos:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QsRyY-b1Aw#t=147
 

Other: If you press R1 too fast at the grapples, the camera may become glitched
for the rest of the Cronos level. The part inside Cronos' throat is especially
problematic, because the camera makes it very difficult to control Kratos, but
it can be completed. After Cronos, the game returns to normal.

Videos:
1, Jolielegal's vid:
        https://youtu.be/rSihwr2MNXA

 
Wasted glitch potential: There is walkable collision above Cronos' shoulder that
you can CG high jump to. From there you can walk around behind the metal areas
on Cronos' shoulder. Then you can Jet Dash to Cronos' face where Kratos can walk
around and inside of Cronos' face.

Wasted glitch potential: If you can get past the blue onyx on Cronos' chin, you
can walk on Cronos' face early (you then get a funny view of Cronos' mouth and
nose). But there is no chance of sparing Cronos at this date by doing this.


Other: as Cronos is dying and doing a faceplant, if you Jet Dash you can end up
flying over the blue onyx stones and the cutscene trigger of Hephaestus making
Kratos the Whip. Later on Aphrodite's Chamber's door also lacks a R1-prompt. (c:

<The Forge re-visit>

Other: For unknown reasons, after the Cronos level, Kratos’ health bar may
become glitched. It shows Kratos’ health at a certain value, when actually it is
full. If you open a green chest, the health bar will still not update to show
Kratos’ real health. If Kratos takes damage, the health bar updates, and
everything returns to normal.


Other (NG+): since Kratos already has the Nemesis whip, he is able to activate
the electrical post so that Hephaestus is killed while he offers Kratos the
whip. However, the R1-prompt to take the whip remains active even though
Hephaestus is dead. Activating the prompt will now bring Hephaestus back to life
very suddenly and initiate the scene where he attacks Kratos. Since you
electrified the post earlier, it cannot be done a second time, so Hephaestus is
stuck in a state where he’s being permanently electrified, until restart.

After restarting, the camera becomes locked on Kratos at almost a first-person
perspective. Due to this, you can return to Aphrodite’s Chamber and see exactly
what Kratos is doing during the sex mini-game. Spoilers, he violently dry-humps
the air… (c: findlestick)

Videos:
1, nanospheres video:
        https://youtu.be/iVX39RI_63A


Sequence break (NG+): it's possible to leave through the portal and skip the
cutscene where Kratos takes the whip. It can be done by High Jumping/Jet Dashing
over the 'electric post' on the right (one of the posts that you normally
electrify to kill Hephaestus). From there you can do a Death-collision jump up
to the platform and enter Aphrodite's Chamber. (It might also be possible to get
up to that platform by doing a Sorrow Jump over the electric post on the right
of screen).
 
Note: If you then want to leave Aphrodite's Chamber through the door near the
savepoint, you must get swimming glitch at the Forge first because the door has
no R1 prompt at this stage. However all of this is useless for any speedrun
because it all takes way too long to do.
 
If you then re-enter the Forge, the game unloads the Hephaestus-giving-Kratos-
the-whip phase, and instead reloads an earlier phase of Hephaestus. This also
reloads Tartarus (for the most part) behind the door that has the Hades emblem.
It's then possible to get beyond that door and enter Tartarus if you have
swimming glitch activated. From there it is possible to swim through the Gates
of Tisiphone and reload Cronos again after already having killed him. (c:

Sequence break (NG): you can get air-swimming glitch at the pool near Hephaestus
by grabbing a ledge on its inside, then simply let go of the ledge to breach the
floor. Air-swim glitch will be activated, and from there, you can skip
everything all the way to the inside of the Labyrinth.

Infinite red orbs: as Hephaestus is handing you the Whip, don't pick it up.
Instead go and save. Now, each time you retry there's a stream of orbs flying at
you, and you can touch the save point between retries to keep the orbs every
single time too. You make a little under 100 orbs per each retry, so it's not a
super fast method of getting infinite orbs, but practically effortless.

Something like this can happen at Labyrinth as well... wonder what causes it?
 
 
Other: if you fail the QTE and Kratos gets electrified, you can keep delaying
the inevitable by turning Hades' Helm on again and again. The Whip will move on
its own over Kratos' fried corpse if you continue this long enough.
 
 
Wasted glitch potential: You can get regenerating magic at the Nemesis Rage
tutorial by CG high jumping out of the tutorial. Unfortunately, you get stuck
with the Whip as your currently equipped weapon for the rest of the game, and
you won't be able to break any onyx at areas that it is required in order to
progress. (c: findlestick)

<Daedalus' Study>

Wasted glitch potential: Under rare circumstances, the ballista can become
completely dislodged from the ground. It can then be moved around freely around
the room and even pushed into one of the portals, this has no effect on the
ballista. Many untested possibilities open up. Are there any further glitching
possibilities using this? What happens if you drag the ballista back out of the
Study and fire it around near the bridge? Or firing it directly from in front of
the Portal at ground level like it is not supposed to happen? Or drag the
ballista around while the rope is already through the portals?

Other: you can reach the yellow portal that you'd normally have to get to with
Boots with a Severe Judgment high jump.
 
 
Collision flaw: at the upper balcony with a switch, there's some strange
collision to the sides of the portal.
 
 
Out of bounds:

It's possible to get out of bounds in at least 6 different ways in the Study.

1. Sorrow Jumping over the yellow portal at the top. (could use better
directions. §)

2. Rolling next to the golden chest that is at the upper left of screen. (c:
AKheon)

3. Making Kratos jump and land on some pots that are to the left hand side of
the blue portal that is right of screen. If you jump on those pots and spam X,
it's possible (but extremely difficult) to get Kratos out-of-bounds, left of the
column that's there.

4. Grabbing a secret ledge above the gate with the Zeus seal. (c: AKheon)

5. Grabbing a secret ledge on the height next to the small steps to the right.
Basically get Kratos between the steps and the table with candles on it, and do
a very light jump forward to have Kratos grab the ledge. From there you can Jet
Dash out of bounds. (c: findlestick)

6. Carefully walking inside the big mirror on the left and carefully going
around the teleportation trigger with the Bow drawn. This lets you drop out of
bounds. (c: findlestick)

3, findlestick's video of the optimal skip-method, entry number 6:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvjuiKoxiSU


Sequence break: by using most of the above OoB methods, it's possible to go and
reach Gardens early from a wrong direction using Jet Dash.

The Gardens aren't located where you'd expect them to be if you want to go there
via OoB. You should Jet Dash heavily to the left of the Daedalus' Study instead.
It's not too difficult to find it since you'll eventually see the lush
background graphics of the Gardens that way.

Some setups (like the 2nd video above) will apparently cause the Hera cutscene
to start on the final platform most of the time for a reason or another. So
experiment a little bit to see what works and what doesn't. (more info wouldn't
hurt §) (c: findlestick)


Wasted glitch potential: the puddles of water on the ground are not 'proper'
water, so you cannot use them to get swimming glitch when you touch them
out-of-bounds.


Random (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated and go out-of-bounds to
the left of the Daedalus study, you will see a strange geometric 'Green house'
floating in nothingness. It has an angled roof structure, plus what look like
handles on all sides. To top it off it has 4 geometric cones attached on all
sides of it. This house shimmers oddly as if it's graphics were bordering on
being 'unstable'. (c: findlestick)

Random (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated and go out-of-bounds to
the right/back of the Daedalus study, you will see two extremely large geometric
golden pillars that resemble 'cricket stumps'. The large golden pillars on the
left have a functional R1 prompt at its very top, if you activate this prompt,
those pillars (on the left) suddenly rise up all on their own complete with an
actual cutscene.
 
The golden pillars on the right do not have an R1 prompt, but should you
approach it, you will suddenly get a cutscene of what looks like an old video
tape gliding through the air towards the Daedalus Study. We have no idea what
functions all these mysterious objects serve, it would be interesting to chat
with a game designer/developer to find out what these objects do. If you are a
game designer/developer please contact us so we can have some idea. (If you
worked on the GoW series...even better!) (c: findlestick)

Other: if you have swimming glitch activated and Kratos is in the neutral
'Sled-riding' pose, and then goes through the blue portal that is at the
lower/right of screen. He will emerge from the upper/right portal doing a
'rope-climbing' animation and he will then stay in that rope-climbing pose. He
will then swim around in this position...but every now and then he will actually
do his rope climbing animation while swimming around.

Other: Teleportation Trigger and Olympus Gardens' actual location.
Trigger location: at the hole where there's a pole Kratos slides down.
Actual location of Olympus Gardens: air-swim or Jet Dash out-of-bounds behind
the hallway that leads back to the Upper Gardens, but without hitting the other
Teleportation Trigger that’s there. You should see the Olympus Gardens very far
away, and extremely low. (c: findlestick)


<Olympus Gardens>

Random: after sliding down the pole and going further into the corridor, the
previous area unloads. At this point you can go and get back on the pole using a
high jump... but it seems you can't go out of bounds here since the walls
enclosing the pole are still too high.


Other (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated, go to the end of the
hallway that leads to the Olympian Gardens and then go right. If you do, there
is a massive 3D area of lush looking green trees and mountains that can be
explored. This area is easily 10 to 15 times larger than the actual Olympian
Gardens itself! As you swim through it, it feels exactly as if you are in a
totally different God of War game... (maybe Kratos is having a 'lucid dream'?)

Cutscene skip: you can skip the 22-seconds long cutscene which shows you a
general view of the place by jumping over it. This is possible on NG without
upgrades or Whip as well if you use "slightly higher double jump" followed by a
RoS jump and Jet Dashing. (c: AKheon)

Cutscene skip and other glitches: a Tale of Two Heras

After much headache, a way to skip the first Hera cutscene was finally found. Do
Sorrow Jump towards the left-side corner that forms as the corridor ends and the
outdoors area begins. Keep Jet Dashing towards the corner. Eventually, you may
clip through, and with more Jet Dashing reach the garden safely. This is very
difficult or at least seemingly random to do...

You don't have to worry about having to skip Hera's Chalice scene, because it
doesn't start after having done this skip. Consequently, it means that the
"bizarre" way of skipping this Garden (read more about it in an entry below) is
not available if you do this.

Now you are able to do some never-before-seen glitches at the Garden. For one,
you have two Hera models: the one at the entrance, and another inside the second
half of the garden. You can move the first model around by pushing it (doing
Cestus magic towards it, for example), but it's arduous. And the camera angles
at the Satyr corridor are totally atrocious. Regardless, if you manage to push
the first model all the way to the bowl which you will eventually have to dump
Hera's corpse into, it too will get a circle prompt above its head.
Congratulations, there are now two Hera corpses you can carry around...
Strangely enough, the first model can't be dumped into the bowl because an
invisible wall near the bowl blocks it. You can also push the first model to the
exit of the Garden, but not much can be done there.
 
You could also try to glitch the cutscene itself, although you don't have much
to work with because if you didn't activate a certain trigger at the stairway
leading to the cutscene (before doing this skip!), Kratos just freezes but no
cutscene ever starts. Same thing happens if you wander too far inside the garden
before activating the trigger. Also, skipping this scene causes no enemies to
spawn, so you can't try to glitch things with them either. (c: AKheon)

Random (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated, go high above the
Olympian Gardens. You will see 5 sets of bizarre geometric golden loops rotating
into each other in a very interesting way. Oh... and there is also a corpse
floating high up in mid air all by itself nearby as well. (Note: These objects
are there only sometimes, I think they appear/disappear when certain triggers
are crossed/skipped).
 
Incidentally...the corpse is located in the same area that Kratos gets
teleported to (initially) when he is broken out from the cutscene where he picks
up Hera's Chalice… (c: findlestick)

Cutscene skip: you can skip the cutscene of Kratos picking up Hera's Chalice by
doing a CG high jump or JJ using one of the enemies that spawn nearby. If you
extend the jump using Bow height gain, you can even get to the yard with the
ladder using this trick. (c: AKheon)

Sequence break: bizarre way to skip Olympus Gardens

Due to a very odd glitch that occurs if Kratos is hit by an enemy during the
Hera's Chalice cutscene, you can completely skip this area without problems. In
order to set up the glitch, you got to first skip Hera's Chalice cutscene, then
approach its trigger from the "wrong side". The enemies that spawn will follow
you all the way to the cutscene area, giving you a chance to start this glitch.
Once Kratos is hit, he will reappear at a completely different area (long before
the camera even shows his new location). The place Kratos ends up at may be the
unloaded Study you passed through earlier. Kratos will stay put for the
remainder of the cutscene, but the first attack you do afterwards has Kratos
turn slanted indefinitely! Definitely strange.

The best use for this strange state is doing Crushing Strike (air) using the
Cestus - Kratos begins flying horizontally, and very conveniently almost towards
The Caverns entrance. This flight lasts endlessly, so you gotta cancel it by
using Rage of Sparta. From there Jet Dashing to The Caverns entrance is not a
big deal. (c: AKheon)

2, findlestick's vid showing this trick from a clearer angle:
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwiBHoaJkn8
 

Speed strategy: you can get on the higher walkway early by doing a Severe
Judgment jump (and Dashing). From on top of it, you can avoid opening the gate
and climbing the ladder there by jumping over an invisible wall towards the
background. You can end up all the way to the area where the first bowl is. (c:
AKheon)
 
 
Speedrun Strategy: You can completely skip the Satyr battle simply by high
jumping/dashing over the loading trigger. And the Satyrs never load.
 
A quicker way is to get yourself stuck behind the green chest before the Satyr
section. This will cause you to be pushed through the wall and directly to the
pushable button that's on the ground. (c: AKheon)
 
Videos:
1, AKheon's vid of the second way:
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7WdsDQKMco


Trigger skip: after passing Satyrs, the cutscene in which the gate closes behind
you can be jumped over.


Sequence break: skipping the rest of Olympus Gardens
 
Push the moving pedestal towards a wall so that the high end is against the
wall. The game may allow Kratos to get through the wall this way. Doing this
near the exit allows you to just jump to the pathway that leads you to the next
area. Note: it's recommended to retry from the last checkpoint once you reach
the pedestal, or else Hera's death scene may suddenly start playing when you are
trying to exit. It isn't dangerous, and it doesn't always happen, but it does
waste time if it does. (c: AKheon)

Note that if you skipped large portions of the Gardens earlier (i.e by Jet
Dashing directly from Daedalus’ Study) you need to hit a trigger to load the
next area. Move the pedestal to the left, at the line where the gate would spawn
later.

There’s an alternative method that doesn’t need the Whip, so it is particularly
worthwhile in a NG run. It is done with a Ladder Infinite Jump in the ladder
near where the pedestal is. Hop onto the ladder, do a single jump that you segue
into Wings Gliding, steer towards the gate that is on the upper level, hold down
the right analog in anticipation, let go of X at a precise moment... and Kratos
should start rising up in the air towards the gate. If Kratos does not start
rising, then your timing was wrong. Too much or too little wait and Kratos won't
get upward momentum out of Glide. Anyway, make Kratos land on top of the gate,
and from there Jet Dash to the final platform. Or to avoid potentially seeing an
unwanted cutscene, do a sideways Jet Dash to the crank beyond the Harpy chasm.

Other: If you skipped activating the cutscene on the pushable button earlier,
you can trigger it by putting Hera on it at this stage. This causes a
contradiction in the game, resulting in a 'Dali-inspired' bizarre cutscene. You
see Kratos drop Hera, but he retains his arm up as if he was still carrying her
with Hera's massive minigame circle rotating before Kratos' face. Kratos has a
bizarre/unnatural look on his face, almost as if hypnotised. At that stage you
see Hera's cup float about all on its own, as well as the green stone. The
cutscene that reveals the puzzle layout has all its green effect missing, and if
you make Kratos walk around, he does so, but with his arm up as if he was
holding Hera. If you then pick Hera up, Kratos carries her for a while but then
he freezes and drops her, at that stage Hera's body drags itself along the floor
- seemingly - all on its own. (c: findlestick)

Other: early Hera's corpse

The trigger for the idly sitting Hera model to appear to the main yard is in the
next doorway from the pedestal. Somehow activate a checkpoint and after retry,
Hera will have died for no reason. You will have her corpse in the main
courtyard long before even seeing her death cinematic. Note that once you finish
filling up the first bowl, the corpse disappears again (only to reappear after
viewing Hera's death cinematic).


Speed strategy: you can use the pedestal to push Hera's corpse around at a
higher-than-normal speed.


Wasted potential: you can get Hera's corpse on top of the small square stand
right next to the last bowl you are supposed to fill (this is before the bowl
has moved its location). Unfortunately, getting her into the bowl may be
impossible... so close, but so far. Also, you can't get Hera's corpse on top of
the moveable pedestal using the green view - when the green view ends, the
corpse just falls down to the ground, as if it had been laying on nothing.
 
 
Other: after doing things out of order for a long time, messing around with the
set, the gate at the end of the higher walkway turned invisible.
 
 
Other: after putting Hera into the bowl, she can't be grabbed and carried around
again. ...unless you go to the last save and make a checkpoint and return. You
can drop her out of the bowl, but aside that she won't move an inch. The game
must've thought she was still in the bowl.
 
 
Other: If you skipped the Hera's Chalice cutscene earlier and then activate the
green effect, you can skip the trigger/cutscene where Kratos breaks the green
crystal by using the "strange" Olympus Puzzle skip (detailed above). You get to
see Kratos cross the harpy chasm while the green effect is still activated.
However, the effect goes away the instant you reach the other side of the chasm.

Speedrun Strategy: Shoot the harpy beforehand to avoid the short scene of the
game showing the harpy.


Speedrun Strategy: You can Jet Dash over the large Harpy Crossing chasm. This is
faster than using the Harpies.

Sequence break: you can skip using the crank to open up the gate made of blocks
by doing a perfect height Sorrow Jump. (c: findlestick)

An alternative method that even works on NG is to use a Harpy that flies high
enough. Get it close to the gate, then jump off it to grab a ledge near the top
of the gate. Climb over, and you can Jet Dash even deeper into the area to save
extra time.

<The Caverns part 2>

Wasted glitch potential: You can get out-of-bounds and under the platform at the
rotating wooden cog. This can be done by doing a normal jump onto the wooden
cog, then another jump in the same direction. From there you can jump to the
wooden platforms that are above and to the sides of the cog, and from there
glide to the left of the screen. Once there you can jump/glide to under the
platform, but nothing is loaded yet below it.


Untested: after riding the elevator down, it's possible to get over the walls
using Sorrow Jump (and maybe other high jumps). You could probably Jet Dash and
cut a few corners, but to what extent without skipping important loading
triggers, it's hard to say.


Sequence break: you can skip the intro cutscene and the ensuing fight with
Cyclops by Jet Dashing straight to the corridor with the save point. (c:
satvara)

Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqzL3V3jZx0


Sequence break: you can skip straight to Skorpius by doing a pretty crazy
maneuver using long Jet Dashes and levitation glitch. First get to where you
meet Daedalus. Then start levitation glitch against one of the corners of the
ledge, and after gaining a lot of height you can Jet Dash to the entrance where
you come to the Skorpius fight from. (c: findlestick)

Skip: you can Jet Dash over the large hall without having to fill it with water.


Wasted Glitch Potential: it’s possible to breach the floor by grabbing the ledge
belonging to the round plate on the floor, in the middle of the room. But the
water in this room won’t activate air-swim glitch until the lever has been
pulled. (c: findlestick)

Videos:

Swimming glitch: you can start swimming glitch here. First fill the hall with
water, then roll behind the right chest - this is easiest with Whip roll. From
there do double jumps against the wall to the right to breach it. Now you can
Glide and hit the water from out of bounds and start swimming glitch. (c:
AKheon)

Videos:
1, AKheon's original vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oy-uCm00iY


Other (swimming): if you have swimming glitch activated, It's possible to
trigger the Cyclops fight followed by making the boxes move by activating the R1
prompt nearby that makes the boxes move (at the battle that is normally after
Skorpius). The Cyclops then lose their AI as their boxes - along with them - get
transported to a totally different area. But this is not recommended, because
you will not be able to fight the Scorpion later, because the Skorpius box has
been moved before the fight has taken place.

If you start fighting Skorpius after the box has been moved, the fight glitches
up before it even has a chance to begin. The Skorpius Spawn that appear keep
falling and dying as soon as they appear, and soon Skorpius itself emerges. It
tries to grab Kratos, but then they both suddenly freeze in mid-air.

It's possible to try fighting Skorpius without swimming glitch as well with the
box absent. Just flying to the box, Kratos dies during the cutscene where
Skorpius Spawn appears and you finally get the game over screen after Skorpius
appears. With very precise maneuvering you can start the fight but make it
safely on solid ground... this allows Kratos to stay alive as the fight starts!
But this variation is also doomed, as Kratos dies for seemingly no reason when
Skorpius tries to grab him. Since you became checkpointed, you are now stuck and
die almost instantly each time you retry. (c: findlestick)

Sequence break: skip Skorpius

It took a while, but there is finally a working tactic to skip Skorpius in a NG
run. Unfortunately it only works on PS4 so far, but it's something at least.

Activate swimming glitch in this area like you'd normally do when first arriving
there. After that, go and activate the prompt above Daedalus. On PS3 this will
crash the game, but on PS4 it just causes some wide-scale graphical corruptions.
After that, backtrack to the rope near where you see the chatting with Daedalus
cutscene to hit a loading trigger. Follow the rope to the first platform before
the grapple points to hit a checkpoint. At this point you should restart the
game and reload the last auto-save to prevent the game crashing later on.
After reloading the game, go and activate the Daedalus switch again. Now the
Labyrinth will form for real, and you can just proceed to go in there, skipping
practically everything in The Caverns, including Skorpius. (c: findlestick)

Videos:

Skips: you can high jump over the trigger which shows you around the darkened
room. It's possible for you to continue Jet Dashing from the heights to skip the
dark walkway. Not sure how close to the exit you can get to by Jet Dashing from
here. §


Speedrun Strategy: on the platform that you use Hermes' Boots to climb a short
wall, there is a piece of collision that should make Kratos levitate up into the
skies if he Glides against it. From the heights you can Jet Dash over the door
to the next area saving maybe a second.

The piece of collision that makes Kratos levitate is located on the front of the
platform that is facing the camera. Just to note that once you levitate, it's
possible to get to the box where Skorpius is while out-of-bounds. But this is
very tricky because the loading triggers are in areas that are difficult to get
to. (c: findlestick)

Random (swimming): if you swim to the chain that Kratos will fly upwards during
the Skorpius fight, camera angle will change respectively. Kratos is also tied
down close to the chain by an invisible wall of collision, and you get stuck.
Too bad there don't seem to be any triggers here that would help skip Skorpius.
 
 
<Skorpius>

Random: for unknown reasons, Kratos can avoid being grabbed by Skorpius during
its introduction scene. It would save time in a speedrun if it could be
reproduced at will. § (c: TodinhoDeFerro)

Other: Kratos is teleported inside the Skorpius fight arena as the boss appears.


Other: leaving Skorpius battle

Due to being surrounded by many enemies, it’s easy to grab the ledges
surrounding the box with a Magneto Jump. You can then breach the floor by
letting go of the ledge and Jet Dashing away. More tests need to be done to see
if this can be exploited in some way, or to find new glitches. § (c:
findlestick)


Speed strategy: before breaking the first 3 of its legs, weaken the other 3
considerably as well because in the second part of the fight it flees often and
there is less luck involved if the remaining legs don't have full HP.


Speed strategy: you can avoid being grabbed by Skorpius by activating Rage of
Sparta.


Random: the onyx on Skorpius’ legs can be broken with Rage of Sparta if you have
Cestus selected, unlike all other onyx in the game.


Other: sometimes one of Skorpius' legs that has a broken onyx appears visually
as if it still had onyx on it. It's just a random graphical glitch.


Random: to further add to the frustration caused by this boss fight, if you're
too close to Skorpius when it turns around and flees during the second phase,
you may get pushed through the floor and fall to your untimely demise.


<The Caverns backtrack>

Other: if you Alt-Jet Dash directly to the first box ride box without using the
grapples on the way, you can activate it like normal. But this way no enemies
will spawn during the box ride.

Videos:
1, findlestick's vid:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUL74maNj8


Sequence break: you can skip the box rides after defeating Skorpius by doing an
intricate jump. First, use the vent to get to the higher platform. From there,
jump towards the lower left side of the big box that is blocking your view. Drop
down fairly low to avoid getting hit by insta-death collision, then Jet Dash to
the boxes.
 
Note: if you skipped The Caverns intro earlier, you'll have to re-skip it now!
Just jump over the floor before where the corridor starts and this should do it.

uselessly. (Looks very comical).

Sequence break (swimming): skip meeting Daedalus

You can start swimming glitch in the hall with two branching paths after
defeating Skorpius to skip meeting Daedalus and also cut a few corners during
the upcoming platforming section. A nice time save, and as an added bonus, you
can activate the Daedalus cutscene after the Labyrinth is complete for some
graphical oddities.

Note that after activating the R1-prompt that constructs the Labyrinth, Kratos
will not be transported to the Labyrinth entrance automatically since he is
swimming. He has to manually swim there instead once the cutscene is done. It's
not a big deal, but it wastes some seconds, and it will be difficult to navigate
to the entrance if you move the wrong way and lose orientation of your
surroundings.

Another warning: this sequence break can lead to a softlock or a crash. I think
it can be avoided by exiting the room where you start swimming glitch near the
back-left (close to the switch that lowers the metal grating). But it could use
some more tests to be sure. (c: AKheon)

On PS4 this skip does not crash the game even if you do it the wrong way. You
instead get some impressive looking graphical glitches as a result.

Wasted potential: the ledges next to the stairs can be used to start a
Levitation Glitch. This enables you to Levitate through the hole in the roof.
However, during the first fight there is death collision at its exit, preventing
you from leaving that way. The death collision is gone once the battle is over.
However, I’ve only ever tried this during phase one of the fight. § (c:
findlestick)


Wasted potential: the floor in this room can be breached with a Magneto Jump.
The step to the left, and right-sides of the gate can be grabbed. But there is
death collision underneath this box preventing you from Jet Dashing very far
without dying. (c: findlestick)


Sequence break: skipping most of the Labyrinth

Once the battle in room one is over, hit a loading trigger located near the end
of the next hallway to load the next areas of the Labyrinth. Return to box one
and start a levitation glitch on a ledge next to the stairs, and levitate Kratos
through the hole in the roof. You won't be able to see Kratos after he's out of
the box, so you will have to practice this a few times to decide on some visual
cues you'll use to roughly determine Kratos' position during this part of the
skip (f.e. when a certain graphic inside box one touches a certain area of the
screen). Levitate higher than the bridge leading from the Water Trap room. That
bridge is located between box two and Pandora's cage. Once you've determined
that Kratos is high enough, Jet Dash towards the final bridge and land on it.

The final room isn't loaded yet, and there are two options to load the final
room, depending on which side of the 'hope cutscene' you landed. If you landed
on the side closer to the final box, you have no choice but to trigger the
cutscene. However, if you landed on the side of the Savepoint, you can try to
skip the cutscene with a method that seems to work 90% of the time: §

High jump to grab the ledge on the door at the Water Trap room's exit, and land
on a small section of invisible floor directly on the other side of the door.
The Water Trap room isn't loaded, so do a short glide towards the screen, to hit
a loading trigger, then return to the small section of floor. From there, do a
high jump to stand on top of the door and do a Sorrow Jump/Jet Dash towards the
final room, going over the cutscene-trigger.

Since Pandora has been skipped, she won't be available to help Kratos progress
beyond the final box. So, this skip can only be done in-conjunction with another
skip that lets you skip the final box without Pandora. That skip is described
further below (see 'skipping the final box').
(c: findlestick)

Videos:
 1, findlestick’s video of skipping nearly all of the Labyrinth:

Sequence break: you can skip the 2nd room of the Labyrinth by going out of
bounds using a bizarre physics glitch that tosses Kratos around. From there, if
you Jet Dash to correct directions, you can reach either the corridor past 1st
room or even to Pandora herself.

Wasted glitch potential: it's possible to high jump on top of the doors which
open and close at the end of the long corridor after 2nd room, but it isn't of
much help in this instance. Reaching the areas above early (using infinite death
floor jump for example) is possible, but Pandora never materializes there, which
would force you to skip the final room. As a funny bonus the "Hope" cutscene is
glitched with no background graphics or Pandora nowhere to be seen.

Sequence break: skip 3rd and 4th Labyrinth rooms

From the 3rd room, it's possible to get out-of-bounds and Jet Dash straight to
the corridor past the 4th room to where the Heart of Labyrinth save is. First
use Hermes' Boots to climb the wall, then do a high jump towards the wall on
your left. There is a secret ledge there, using which you can jump through the
ceiling. Jet Dash towards the background and to the right to reach the bridge
leading to Pandora early. As a funny bonus, Pandora is invisible in the upcoming
cutscene if you did this. (c: AKheon)

Random: The spikes of the fight before the Heart of the Labyrinth are not
random. In the first phase of the fight, the spikes will follow one of four
patterns, and in the second phase, one of two patterns. Which pattern you get is
random. If you restart checkpoint at the fight, the pattern of the first phase
spikes will remain the same, while the second phase spikes can change.


Sweet spot: In the second phase of the Spikes fight, you can climb on the
elevated surface on the side of the floor, avoiding the deadly spikes.

Other: If you cancel the Cestus attack (by flicking bow or head with L2)
immediately after destroying the onyx protection of Pandora’s cage, the door
will glitch out, and the R1 command to open it will not appear. On PS3, due to
the longer time to set a checkpoint, this can actually softlock the game, as the
checkpoint will be set after the glitch happens.

<Heart of the Labyrinth>

Infinite red orbs: you can do a very slow infinite red orbs glitch here. After
having broken the onyx leading to Pandora's room, return and save at the save
point. Now, every time you retry you get a bunch of orbs from the broken onyx,
and if you create a new checkpoint by touching the save you get to keep them
too. But this is literally only 8-30 orbs per retry, so you have to spend a
while to get a noteworthy amount of orbs.


Wasted speed strategy: it's possible to open up the small hatch during the fight
with Gorgons and soldiers, but Pandora is not going to enter before the fight is
over.


Other: Once you've pulled the crank and Pandora has entered the hatch, Kratos
will remain in that pose if you keep R1 held, even though the room has changed
and the crank is no longer there.


Other: At the end of the battle with the Gorgons and co, you can get yourself
trapped in the cage with Pandora by rolling quickly into the cage instantly
after Pandora has entered it.


Other: it’s possible to obstruct the hole that Pandora enters, with Permanent
Archer Souls. Pandora will enter the hole but she gets stuck on the other side,
and won’t stand on the button. The camera will then pan-up as if the large wall
is opening, but the wall never actually opens. Kratos and Pandora are then
permanently stuck and you’re softlocked.

A word of warning about testing this. If you had created Permanent Archer Souls
before the room rotated, your Autosave file will become corrupted later when the
room rotates and you restart.
(c: findlestick)


Other: if you're too late in letting Pandora out of the cage that is being
penetrated by large blades, you get game over (unsurprisingly). The game counts
the cutscene in which Pandora is exiting the cage as time she is in danger, so
you might fail even though she gets scot-free!


Wasted glitch potential: The instant you've pulled the crank and Pandora has
escaped the puzzle, you can make Kratos roll inside the trap that Pandora has
just left. The blades in the trap don't harm Kratos in any way. He can even
climb around inside the trap. Unfortunately (at this date), you can't get to the
next room from inside there to see if there are any speedrun/exploit potentials.
From inside the trap you can only backtrack to Pandora's cage, and as amusing as
it is to see some graphical glitches...you get stuck!


Out of bounds: it's possible to get Kratos to climb on the other side of the
long ladder leading up to the Pandora water trap (so he will be climbing
out-of-bounds). It can happen by accident, but it can also be done on purpose.

To do it, simply make Kratos jump back from the upper section of the ladder into
a descending Ladder Jump (so drop down to the lower section of the ladder while
Kratos does his Ladder Jump animation). When the camera angle changes to show
the bottom section of the ladder, Kratos will breach the collision of the ladder
if you spam L1 while pressing Kratos against the ladder (during the Ladder Jump
animation).


Wasted skip potential (NG+): skipping water trap room
 
Do the out of bounds glitch mentioned above. Once you are climbing on the
out-of-bounds side of the Ladder, doing an ascending Ladder Jump will make
Kratos rise up and skip the trigger that normally loads the upper section of the
ladder. Most of the time Kratos will then grab a ledge and end up walking around
on the top of the box belonging to the lower section of the ladder. If you then
walk to the right/towards the camera and do a high jump into Jet Dash, it's
possible to reach the next savepoint that you normally get to after completing
the Pandora water trap puzzle (using death-collision jump). However, it's of no
use because Pandora can't get to the next chamber since you leave her behind,
getting you stuck.
 
Interestingly, it turns out that the upper area of the ladder is actually to the
upper right of the lower section of the ladder...if that makes sense? (c:

Other: two Pandoras and other oddities

By doing things in the wrong order, you can have two Pandoras appear in the
water trap room! First skip to the corridor after the water trap room after the
Gorgon fight, then enter the water trap room and activate the prompt that turns
the room around. One Pandora appears out of nothing in the middle of the room
and falls down to the rotating blades below.

Then, if you leave the water trap room you can go to the room's entrance and hit
another trigger that loads yet another Pandora to appear - she too falls down to
the rotating blades.

If you now leave the water trap room again and backtrack to the smaller blade
trap after the Gorgon fight, there is no one inside the cage as the blades start
descending. You can hold the little door open, but there is no Pandora to escape
from the trap, and thus you automatically fail the trap at the end and get a
game over. (c: findlestick)

Wasted potential: if you activate the final R1-prompt of the water trap room
early, it changes color but nothing else happens.


Collision flaw: at the lower edge of the water trap, there's a small ledge
Kratos can stand on, or accidentally pass through the wall to become trapped
with Pandora! It's the easiest to hit with a SJ jump to a quick Dash.

While inside the trap, you can't pick up Pandora. If you do get inside when the
water is flowing, you have less room to move, with an invisible ceiling right
over you. Maybe it is the platform the swimming pandora rests on?

Speed strategy: using the same collision flaw, it's possible for you to finish
this puzzle room using an alternative route. The correct position is pretty hard
to hit, but you can potentially save maybe up to 20 secs of time and cause a few
glitches in the process.
 
First, you skip pulling the platform away from the wall, and the cutscene in
which water flows into the trap. Yes, the timed section of the puzzle never
begins this way and Pandora doesn't drown no matter how long you wait here.
Later on this causes some graphical glitches of Pandora inside the box, and at
the very end she strangely ends up fainting on top of the box... Because of
Pandora's strange location, you break out of the scene in which Kratos talks to
her afterwards and can move during this short time.
 
Like in the Oracle skip of GoW 1, you can still hear the sound loop of the
victim's shouts of help even after you've saved her, making light of the whole
situation really.
 
It's also possible to use this route using Sorrow Jump, which is a far easier
method. Or if you have infinite health (NG+), you can just land on top of the
spikes and activate RoS to run to one of the climbing walls and continue from
there. (c: AKheon)

Speedrun strategy (NG+): you don't need to wait for that large spiked cube to
drop before climbing on the grapple. Thanks to infinite health, when the cube
drops on Kratos it just goes through him. And from there Kratos will either
continue climbing like normally (saving time) or he will 'shake' violently as
the cube pushes him up through the ceiling in preparation to do the following
skip featured below...


Sequence break: water trap room skip

It's possible to skip the later half of this room on both NG+ or NG. By just
breaching the wall from the side Pandora is at, you can skip finishing the water
trap and continue into the "endurance room". However, you should only do this
after having turned the room upside down, or else Pandora will not teleport to
Kratos afterwards, getting you stuck.

The original NG+ method found by findlestick was to let Kratos get crushed
between the roof and the moving block that has spikes all over it. When Kratos
is pushed against the roof, he goes out-of-bounds and ends up standing on top of
the box. From there you just need to double jump followed up by doing a Glide
towards the background. If done right you will end up at the next savepoint
before the endurance room.
 
A newer, faster and NG-compatible method is to turn the room upside down, then
jump to the climbing wall to the back. Then jump away from the wall and Glide to
the left-back side to walk on an invisible ledge. If you jump and do a Dash at a
correct height, Kratos will mistakenly start climbing the climbing wall that's
under him from the wrong side, and just like that, you're out of bounds. Just
Gliding will again suffice to reach the Hope-cutscene and continue from there.

Wasted glitch potential: you can Jet Dash above the Hope-cutscene in the next
corridor after having escaped the water trap early, but you get stuck since you
need Pandora to press down the button that makes the Endurance room rise up.


Wasted glitch potential: You can skip the battle trigger for the final fight by
high jumping onto the rails in front of you at the lowering platform. But since
the hole for Pandora to crawl through is not revealed at this stage (coupled
with the fact that Pandora is left behind when doing this) you can not proceed
and get stuck.


Wasted Glitch Potential: by getting on-top-of the rail as mentioned above, you
can Jet Dash to the rear of the room and start a Death collision jump there.
This will take you up to the Teleportation Trigger located in the gap in the
roof, and teleport you to a mostly-empty area where the Top of the Labyrinth
will be loaded later. As a result, Kratos gets stuck standing on an alternate
“rising-platform” that is supposed to raise you later, to the real Top of the
Labyrinth. Not only will the alternate rising-platform not rise, but the Top of
the Labyrinth isn’t loaded until the battle in the final room is triggered.

If you do the above, but during the battle, the result is mostly the same.
Except that the camera will show the real area where the Top of the Labyrinth
is. Kratos is standing inside an alternate final box there, on the alternate
rising-platform. The alternate rising-platform won’t rise and you can’t seem to
High Jump out-of. Perhaps grabbing a ledge on the side of the alternate
rising-platform could start a Levitation Glitch? Or a Death collision jump? §
(c: findlestick)


Other: By high jumping up onto the rails before the final fight (at the lowering
platform) you can jump up on the roof and do pointless roof grapple climbing.


Sequence break: skipping the final box

The final box can be skipped by breaching the floor with a Magneto Jump, where
the golden chest is. Once you’re out-of-bounds, switch to a sideways Jet Dash as
soon as you can, and go directly to where Pandora’s cage was previously loaded.
Keep going in that same direction until you see the Top of the Labyrinth. You
see, the Top of the Labyrinth isn’t actually located above the final box, it’s
actually located lower and not that far away.

However, taking the most direct route means that you’ll Jet Dash through an area
where the camera spins horribly, making Kratos spin in a circle, while losing
height. To get a (barely) manageable camera angle, take a long detour around
that area, while trying to maintain a sideways Jet Dash, so as to not lose any
height. Accidently change to a forward Jet Dash and you might not make the
distance.

In short, squeeze everything from your sideways Jet Dash. Since you’ll sometimes
be quite far off-camera, be prepared for the controls to occasionally switch to
being in reverse. This definitely happens when you’re close to the Top of the
Labyrinth, you must change the direction that you’re leaning the controller when
the camera-angle suddenly changes to show the Top of the Labyrinth. (c:

Battle exploit: At the final fight, you can jump up to the ledge and be out of
harm's way by doing a CG high jump or JJ. It's best to then drop down behind the
bars so you can more easily deal damage to enemies while being out of harm's
way.


Other: You can get stuck if one of the Wraiths burrows itself up onto one of the
upper platforms of this area. It can't be killed (most likely) thus causing you
to restart and do the entire battle again.

Other: Teleport-trigger and Top of Labyrinth's actual location.
Trigger location: the gap in the roof of the final box.
Actual location of the Top of Labyrinth: Jet Dash to down to where the game
previously had loaded Pandora's cage. (c: findlestick)


<Top of the Labyrinth>
 
Wasted potential: There's the Chain of Balance again, but it seems Kratos
refuses to climb it yet at this stage.
 
 
<Three Judges backtrack>
 
Fight skip: well, skipping most of the fight at least. You can use CG high jump
on Satyrs to exit the Hades Cerberus Breeder fight early. The rest of the Judges
area suffers from graphical glitches after this, though everything works
normally.

It's unknown what would be the easiest way to do this skip on NG, where you
don't necessarily have Whip for doing the CG high jump with. (c: AKheon)
 
Videos:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7hr538pWBE


Wasted potential: it's impossible to return to any of the Hades areas you
visited near the start of the game. In fact, trying to leave by the exit near
the rope cross will crash your game. Nothing also happens if you try to swim up
the chain.


Speedrun strategy: You can get down to the 3rd Judge's onyx stone by using CG
high jump or JJ to get over a wall of collision and then Jet Dashing to the
lower platform, skipping the climbing wall. And you can get down to the chain by
high jumping over that same Judge's head directly down to the chain base. Now,
the second time here at The Judges, after breaking the chain there will be a
short glitched scene of Kratos floating next to the pandora statue wearing his
Cestus while in a static flying position (loading time?). Then Kratos will
suddenly be flying up the Icarus vent after a short while.


Wasted glitch potential: After doing the shortcut above, when you then break the
chain, there is a short period of time where Kratos is free to move around as
the next cutscene loads. If you then R1 the savepoint, you will see the chains
breaking cutscene while in the save menu. After the cutscene has completed,
Kratos is still near the chain, but the chain is "floating" there without the
blue sections there.

There's some more info on this in the first Three Judges section as well.

Random: The flight up takes a lot less time than the flight down...


<Zeus 2D-match>

Wasted potential: this arena has a ceiling, so getting out is probably
impossible, despite the fact that you can get to the very top. Zeus can be used
for doing Jest Jump, and doing a Death Jump is not out of the question either if
you can Jet Dash towards the wall with Zeus underneath for long enough.

Videos:
1, findlestick's escape attempt using death jump:
        https://youtu.be/SqXJ3tGMsYI?t=164


Untested: Could it be possible to clip through the wall at the Zeus 2D-match by
summoning a Centaur or other Souls? §


Untested: Attacking the pillars to the sides of the Zeus 2D-area registers hits.
Could it be possible to breach the floor by grabbing potential ledges
surrounding it, or grab a very high ledge with Magneto Jump? §


Random: Zeus stops using air attacks after you drop his health down to the level
where the mini-game prompt activates. Guess the developers thought it would be
too annoying for you to chase him down if he continued flying around the place.


Other: you can break out of the second mini-game (which ends the fight) by
casting some damaging Soul right before grabbing Zeus, making the soul hit him
while Kratos is rushing him towards the wall. More specifically, Zeus becomes
broken out of the mini-game! Kratos continues running towards the wall for a
while by himself and the camera becomes glitched, but that's all the good this
trick is for. (c: AKheon)

Videos:

Other: Maybe due to some loading error, Zeus may become "invisible" during this
fight.

<Destroyed Chambers>

Other: one of the pillars in the area can be attacked with magic to gain hits.
This isn't useful in any way, unless you have regen magic and want to build an
extremely long hit combo effortlessly.


Other: You can Jet Dash over the trigger which begins the next Zeus fight.
Nothing interesting happens - Zeus is just a passive model you can push around
the room with your attacks. If you push him too south, the next cutscene begins
with him absent, and the entire first fight is spent with him stuck outside the
arena.

There's also some walkable collision on the left and right side of the higher
area you come from, blocked by rubble. You can go around the rubble with a Jet
Dash if you're curious.

Random: The first fight is a timed section, and it doesn't matter whether you
attempt to attack Zeus or not.


Other: by accident or potentially on purpose, you can get Kratos fall out of
bounds when the scene shifts into Heart of Gaia. If controlled - pushing Zeus
outside the arena in the previous fight with him might be a factor - you could
probably skip some navigating inside the Heart, saving time. However, for most
people this glitch is an unwanted guest, and they become stuck since they become
checkpointed outside bounds and always die when this section begins.

Sequence break: The same Sorrow Jump that is done in the beginning of the game
to skip some wall navigation inside Gaia can also be performed at the end. Here,
however, you don’t need to hit any loading trigger before the jump, as was
needed the first time.

Speed strategy: Fast Zeus 2 kill

In the second phase of the fight, air-grabbing Zeus -- when his health is just
below the threshold at which he goes to the air and creates clones, skips the
last phases of the fight. But how this works is currently unknown. §

Each difficulty has a precise amount of damage you need to deal to Zeus before
attempting the air-grab. In the first phase of the fight, damage Zeus in any way
possible, it's only in the second phase that the strategy matters.

To air-grab Zeus, Claws air triangle attack is preferred, since it has very
low-damage, so if the grab fails you can try again a few times before Zeus'
health passes the threshold. There is RNG involved with the air grab, so failing
sometimes is expected.

Videos:
1, Jolielegal’s video of some examples of optimized strategies
        https://youtu.be/TXswgrlO9ng


Speed strategy (NG): As soon as the final quick-time-event starts during the
Zeus fight, restart to make the QTE command move faster. But don’t restart too
early; do it when Zeus hits the Heart after being pushed by Kratos. We don’t
recommend this trick on NG+, as QTEs are faster because of Hephaestus’ Ring.

Wasted potential: it seems that in the small screen before the Fear
Kratos-sequence walls are too high to cross with known jumps.


<Fear Kratos>

Speed strategy: You can move for a few seconds in complete darkness before the
intro cutscene kicks in.


Random: If you load the auto-save that begins from this area, you can access
Start-menu (which you couldn't otherwise). Visiting it reveals that at this
point Kratos has lost everything of his gear except the Nemean Cestus, Icarus
Wings and Boots of Hermes.


Event glitch: If you retry, at the very start of the intro cutscene you have a
small period of time during which you can do moves, influencing the next section
slightly. Changing weapons to Nemean Cestus and then trying to attack causes the
Cestus to appear and get stuck on Kratos' hands, and the lighting around Kratos
diminishes greatly. It's also possible to get Boots of Hermes on Fear Kratos,
but trying to use them crashes the game. (c: findlestick)

I've heard that doing this even crashes the game on PS4.

Videos:

<End game>

Speed strategy: When fighting Ghost Zeus, the fastest attack is the
square+triangle combo, repeated 6 times.


Speed strategy: Stop bashing Zeus' head in after the screen turns red, or else
the section will continue indefinitely.


Random: Speedrunners might wonder at this point how are they gonna measure their
game time in the end. There are no save possibilities and you can't access
Start-menu to view your time either. Well, here's a solution: load the auto-save
that begins from the cutscene of fires of hope gleaming in Kratos' eyes. Now you
can for some reason access Start-menu, and the final time can be seen.

And of course a RTA doesn't have this problem.


<Challenges>

Other (NG+): using NG+ glitch in Challenges

If you start NG+ glitch and then enter any of the Challenges, you can take all
gear and infinite health into a Challenge, usually making them very easy to
complete in the process. For example the Challenge where Kratos is supposed to
get stonefrozen X amount of times without dying... with infinite health this
challenge becomes nearly impossible to fail.

Some challenges are a special case, though, like Bare Hands. Kratos will not get
Blades when entering this challenge, but he can change to any other weapon just
fine. Attacking is finicky, but getting hit by an opponent sometimes unlocks his
ability to attack back. Rapid Switch into Blades does not work. You can even do
invisible attacks with Kratos' missing Blades with enough trickery, but any
triangle moves will crash the game, so this is not advisable.

Videos:
1, findlestick's quick vid of NG+ glitch in Challenges:
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-_NXzZGs4


Other (NG+): Fear Itself glitches

If you enter Fear Itself after having done the NG+ glitch, you can attack Fear
Kratos using some attacks that the game didn't expect you to use against him,
causing glitchy reactions and other odd stuff to happen.

The most interesting reaction to note is with Olympus Archer magic, that will
bounce Fear Kratos high in the air. If you then try to shoot at him with normal
Bow shots, he'll evade backwards and fall out of bounds, becoming defeated
almost instantly. (c: AKheon)

Another particularly strange thing is if you first beat another Challenge while
falling under the map, then enter Fear Kratos. This causes Fear Kratos to spawn
with a golden sheen on him, as if he was shined by with Head of Helios. If you
now parry him, he becomes bounced for no reason every now and then, preventing
him from doing any reasonable offense towards Kratos. Sometimes it happens so
rapidly too that Fear Kratos flies in air, never to be seen again.

Sometimes Fear Kratos can also lose A.I. and only dashes towards Kratos until
you attack him back.
